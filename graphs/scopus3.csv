This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual's levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization. As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent. Objective: This study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content. Methods: We conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care. Results: Adults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone. Conclusions: Patients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs. © Katherine Easton, Stephen Potter, Remi Bec, Matthew Bennion, Heidi Christensen, Cheryl Grindell, Bahman Mirheidari, Scott Weich, Luc de Witte, Daniel Wolstenholme, Mark S Hawley.","Artificial intelligence; Chronic illness; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Comorbidity; Computer-assisted therapy; COPD; Mental health; Self-management; Virtual systems","Adult; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Social Support; Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy; adult; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; female; human; male; mental health; middle aged; mortality; procedures; social support; virtual reality exposure therapy","","","","","National Institute for Health Research, NIHR","This research was funded and supported by the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Yorkshire and Humber.

Un-Kit represents a seemingly uncompleted set of sensors, actuators and media elements that have a decontextualized appearance - unfinished state, undefined purpose and unboxed form. The approach emphasises users contemplating and experiencing the IoT elements in their familiar space through detailed and layered conversation with researchers; rather than focusing on connecting up the kit itself, thus their ideas are not constrained by the kit or their competence with it. We illustrate the approach through in-home workshops with older adults, envisioned users of IoT who have had limited voice in its conception. The Un-kit approach supported participants to lead the process and to imagine new artfully integrated designs, with personally legible interactions and aesthetic qualities that fit their desire. We offer insights for a more situated and responsive approach to design of the IoT and its constituent kits. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Co-design; Internet of things; IoT; Older adults; Situated; Toolkit","Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Aesthetic qualities; Co-design approach; Co-designs; Integrated designs; IOT applications; Older adults; Situated; Toolkit; Internet of things","","","","","","","Aceros J.C., Pols J., Domenech M., Where is grandma?

Based on observation, recordings and the developed VR application we present the results of the workshops and offer considerations and recommendations for organizing opportunities for end users, in this case older adults, to directly engage in co-creation of cutting-edge ICT solutions. These include co-designing interfaces and interaction schemes for emerging technologies like VR and AR. We discuss such aspects as user engagement and hardware and software tools suitable for participatory prototyping of VR applications. Finally, we present ideas for further research in the area of VR participatory prototyping with users of various proficiency levels, taking steps towards developing a unified framework for co-design in AR and VR.

Most older adults prefer to age in place, and technologies, including Internet of things (IoT), Ambient/Active Assisted Living (AAL) robots and other artificial intelligence (AI), can support independent living. However, a top-down design process creates mismatches between technologies and older adults’ needs. A user-centered design approach was used to identify older adults’ perspectives regarding AAL and AI technologies and gauge interest in participating in a co-design process. A survey was used to obtain demographic characteristics and assess privacy perspectives. A convenience sample of 31 retirement community residents participated in one of two 90-min focus group sessions. The semi-structured group interview solicited barriers and facilitators to technology adoption, privacy attitudes, and interest in project co-design participation to inform technology development. Focus group sessions were audiotaped and professionally transcribed. Transcripts were reviewed and coded to identify themes and patterns. Descriptive statistics were applied to the quantitative data. Identified barriers to technology use included low technology literacy, including lack of familiarity with terminology, and physical challenges, which can make adoption difficult. Facilitators included an eagerness to learn, interest in co-design, and a desire to understand and control their data. Most participants identified as privacy pragmatics and fundamentalists, indicating that privacy is important to older adults. At the same time, they also reported a willingness to contribute to the design of technologies that would facilitate aging independently. There is a need to increase technology literacy of older adults along with aging literacy of technologists. © 2019 by the authors.

This overarching question guided this multidisciplinary collection. Emerging technologies, particularly new information and communication technologies, can lead to positive outcomes in later life, contributing to quality of life and social connectedness. However, they can also increase social inequalities and exclusion among older adults. Non-use and poor use of technologies can limit access to information, public services, and opportunities for social participation. Thus, understanding different forms of adoption and use, of non-adoption and non-use, as well as its social impact is critical to inform effective development, implementation, and assessment of emerging technologies. Yet, this knowledge is often confined within disciplinary silos. To overcome this problem, this book brings together, for the first time, researchers from social and computer sciences to explore theoretical, methodological, ethical, and empirical approaches to this pressing topic. This novel multidisciplinary approach provides a comprehensive discussion of participatory design, technology adoption models, sociotechnical frameworks, ageing theories, research design, and ethical principles, while investigating technologies such as virtual reality, digital games, robots, software applications, and social networking sites. These original contributions advance our knowledge in this field, ensuring researchers and professionals have a set of enduring examples, guidelines, and practices to design and evaluate emerging technologies that address both the opportunities and challenges of an ageing population. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Ageing; Digital technologies; Emerging technologies; Multidisciplinary research; Sociotechnical systems","","","","","","","","Baecker R., Sellen K., Crosskey S., Boscart V., Neves B.B., Technology to reduce social isolation and loneliness, Proceedings of the 16Th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers & Accessibility, pp. 27-34, (2014); Baker S., Waycott J., Pedell S., Hoang T., Ozanne E., Older People and Social Participation: From Touch-Screens to Virtual Realities, Proceedings of the International Symposium on Interactive Technology and Ageing Populations, pp. 34-43, (2016); Barnard Y., Bradley M.D., Hodgson F., Lloyd A.D., Learning to use new technologies by older adults: Perceived difﬁculties, experimentation behaviour and usability, Computers in Human Behavior, 29, 4, pp. 1715-1724, (2013); Berkowsky R.W., Rikard R.V., Cotten S.R., Signing off: Predicting discontinued ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living, International Conference on Human Aspects of IT for the Aged Population, pp. 389-398, (2015); Biggs S., Negotiating Ageing: Cultural Adaptation to the Prospect of a Long Life, (2017); Breuer J.M., A Handbook of Assistive Devices for the Handicapped Elderly: A New Help for Independent Living, (1982); Brownsell S., Bradley D., Assistive Technology and Telecare: Forging Solutions for Independent Living, (2003); Choi N.G., Dinitto D.M., The digital divide among low-income homebound older adults: Internet use patterns, eHealth literacy, and attitudes toward computer/Internet use, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 15, 5, (2013); Choi R.N., Kong S., Jung D., Computer and internet interventions for loneliness and depression in older adults: A meta-analysis, Healthcare Informatics Research, 18, pp. 191-198, (2012); Cotten S.R., Anderson W., McCullough B., The impact of ICT use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults, Gerontechnology, 11, pp. 161-169, (2012); Curryer C., Malta S., Fine M., Contesting Boomageddon?

Overall, the paper reports on the emerging wellness management concept and IoT solution. The three studies adopt a stakeholder evaluation approach to requirements elicitation and solution design. Human factors research combines several qualitative human–machine interaction (HMI) design frameworks/methods, including realist ethnography, process mapping, persona-based design, and participatory design. Software development activities are underpinned by SCRUM/AGILE frameworks. Three structuring principles underpin the resident’s lived experience and the proposed ‘sensing’ framework. This includes (1) resident wellness, (2) the resident’s environment (i.e., room and broader social spaces which constitute ‘home’ for the resident), and (3) care delivery. The promotion of resident wellness, autonomy, quality of life and social participation depends on adequate monitoring and evaluation of information pertaining to (1), (2) and (3). Furthermore, the application of ambient assisted living technology in a residential setting depends on a clear definition of related care delivery processes and allied social and interpersonal communications. It is argued that independence (and quality of life for older adults) is linked to technology that enables interdependence, and specifically technology that supports social communication between key roles including residents, caregivers, and family members. © 2019 by the authors.

Nevertheless, these resources may be difficult for caregivers to find. A co-design study was conducted to address the gap between caregivers and access to resources. The purpose of this study was to support the process of help seeking by caregivers of functionally impaired older adults through electronic health (eHealth). Objective: The purpose of this study was to focus on the identification of functional and content requirements for an eHealth tool to support the help-seeking process of caregivers of functionally impaired older adults. Methods: This study uses a co-design process based on qualitative action research approach to develop an eHealth tool with health and social service professionals (HSSPs), community workers, and caregivers. The participants acted as co-designers in identifying requirements for the tool. A total of 4 design workshops and 1 advisory committee session were held in different locations in Quebec, Canada. Activities were videotaped and analyzed with a conceptual framework of user experience. Results: A total of 11 caregivers, 16 community workers, and 11 HSSPs participated in identifying the requirements for the eHealth tool. Several functional and content requirements were identified for each user need (19). Content requirements differed depending on the category of participant, corresponding to the concept of user segmentation in the design of information and communication technology. Nevertheless, there were disagreements among co-designers about specific functionalities, which included (1) functionalities related to the social Web, (2) functionalities related to the evaluation of resources for caregivers, and (3) functionalities related to the emerging technologies. Several co-design sessions were required to resolve disagreements. Conclusions: Co-designers (participants) were able to identify functional and content requirements for each of the previously identified needs; however, several discussions were required to achieve consensus. Decision making was influenced by identity, social context, and participants' knowledge, and it is a challenge to reconcile the different perspectives. The findings stressed the importance of allowing more time to deal with the iterative aspect of the design activity, especially during the identification of requirements of an eHealth tool. © Mélanie Tremblay, Karine Latulippe, Anik MC Giguere, Véronique Provencher, Valérie Poulin, Véronique Dubé, Manon Guay, Sophie Ethier, Andrée Sévigny, Maude Carignan, Dominique Giroux.
