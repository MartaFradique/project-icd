Modern systems are capable of producing an information flood that, however, keeps users away from what they need. There are fascinating places that often remain hidden due to the overload of information. In this scenario, it would be interesting to introduce a recommendation methodology that brings the right information to the user according to their profile, ensuring a unique and tailored experience. This paper aims to propose a Content-Based Recommender System able to exploit Singular Value Decomposition proprieties. The Recommender System will be used to recommend hidden cultural sites through the support of the Digital Storytelling and Context-Aware approach.

Human activity is described as temporal variation of the human body. Capturing and assessing multimedia content of dance remains beneficial for the conservation of cultural heritage, for creating video recommendation systems, for aiding learners to employ tutoring systems, and so on. Indian classical dance (ICD) classification remains a fascinating discipline due to its intricate body posture. This gives a stage for examining diverse computer vision alongside deep learning notions. Through modification in learning styles, automated teaching solutions became unavoidable over all disciplines, from classical to online forums. Furthermore, ICD becomes a necessary portion of a prosperous cultural and heritage that at any means should be updated and conserved. Although several classification approaches prevail for bidimensional dance images, in this study, we define the issue of dance style classification for classifying Indian dance. The dance consists of intricate poses like full-body rotation and self-occlusion, and we proffer three-phase deep learning techniques. Initially, we excerpted necessary joint positions of the dance out of every video frame by pre-trained paradigm, TensorFlow Mobile Net Architecture, that assists us in assessing whatsoever body position within the frame. Next, correlative or identification of the determined action factors by Cosine Similarity was employed. Lastly, we classified the dance pose by excerpted salient details and trained this employing Convolution Neural Network – Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) Network structure utilizing training dataset of system for classification. We incorporate a feature vector of flow, angles linking anchor joint, and regularised remoteness vectors that catch proximity configuration in skeletal design rather than providing an informal chain of joints in sequence learner that ordinarily obstructs network execution. Therefore, kinematic association amidst body joints through frames employing pose assessment aids in finer showing of the Spatio-temporal reliance. The proffered CNN-LSTM structure for dance classification is compared with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional LSTM (LRCN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), CONB3D and LSTM concerning criteria like F1-score, accuracy, recall, AUC curve and precision. Therefore, determined that the proffered CNN-LSTM classification structure attains 98.53% of accuracy, 99.04% of precision, 98.47% of recall, 99.12% of AUC score, and 98.72% of F1-score during the examining procedure. During the training procedure, this attains 94.01% of accuracy, 93.11% of precision, 94.76% of recall, 96.06% of AUC score, and 93.51% of F1-score. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Feature extraction; Indian classical dance; Pose assessment; Similarity index","Computer vision; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Recommender systems; Convolution neural network; F1 scores; Features extraction; Indian classical dance; Memory network; Multilayers perceptrons; Pose assessment; Pose-estimation; Short term memory; Similarity indices; Classification (of information)","","","","","","","Rahmani H., Mian A., Shah M., Learning a deep model for human action recognition from novel viewpoints, IEEE Trans.

With the help of proper names and terms in China’s Imperial Maritime Customs archives, this manuscript aims to solve the problem. When the corresponding translation, domain or attributes of a proper name or term is known, it will be easier for some archive translation tasks to be completed, and the adaptive archive intelligent recommendation system will also improve the efficiency of intelligent recommendation quality of archive translation tasks. These related domains or attributes are different labels of these archives. To put it simply, multi-label classification means that the same instance can have multiple labels or be labelled into multiple categories, which is called multi-label classification. With the multi-label classification, archives can be classified into different categories, such as the trade archives, preventive archives, personnel archives, etc. The system users are divided into different professional domains by some tests, for instance, system users who are good at economic knowledge and users who have higher language skills. With these labels, the intelligent recommendation system can make the intelligent match between the archives and system users, so as to improve the efficiency and quality of intelligent archive translation tasks. In this manuscript, through multi-label classification, the intelligent recommendation system can realize the intelligent allocation of archive translation tasks to the system users. The intelligent allocation is realized through the construction of intelligent control model, and verifies that the intelligent recommendation system can improve the performance of task allocation over time without the participation of task issuers.

This study applies a type of machine learning (ML) technique, collaborative filtering (CF) recommender system algorithms, to investigate the comparison between satisfaction with the current job and potential satisfaction with job alternatives, which is inherent in theorizing about individual turnover decisions. The comparison of those anticipated ratings along with employee's current job satisfaction creates two operationalizations: the quantity of more desirable job alternatives and the quality (or extent of desirability) of job alternatives. To test the effectiveness of this novel approach, we applied recommender system algorithms to a longitudinal archival dataset of employees and had three main findings. First, the recommender system algorithms efficiently predicted job satisfaction based on just two sources of information (i.e., work history and job satisfaction in previous jobs), providing construct validity evidence for recommender systems. Second, both the quantity and the quality of more desirable job alternatives compared to the current job positively correlated with employees’ future turnover behavior. Finally, our CF recommender system algorithms predicted where employees moved to, and even more effectively if constraining the alternative jobs to the same occupation. We conclude with implications how recommender system algorithms can help scholars effectively test theoretical ideas and practitioners predict and reduce turnover. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Machine learning; Retention; Turnover; Work Attitudes","","","","","","","","Allen D.G., Bryant P.C., Vardaman J.M., Retaining talent: Replacing misconceptions with evidence-based strategies, Academy of Management Perspectives, 24, pp. 48-64, (2010); Allen D.G., Hancock J.I., Vardaman J.M., Mckee D.N., Analytical mindsets in turnover research, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 35, S1, pp. S61-S86, (2014); Barragans-Martinez A.B., Costa-Montenegro E., Burguillo J.C., Rey-Lopez M., Mikic-Fonte F.A., Peleteiro A., A hybrid content-based and item-based collaborative filtering approach to recommend TV programs enhanced with singular value decomposition, Information Sciences, 180, 22, pp. 4290-4311, (2010); Bergman M.E., Payne S.C., Boswell W.R., Sometimes pursuits don't pan out: Anticipated destinations and other caveats: Comment on hom, mitchell, lee, and griffeth (2012), Psychological Bulletin, 138, pp. 865-870, (2012); Blau G., Further exploring the relationship between job search and voluntary individual turnover, Personnel Psychology, 46, 2, pp. 313-330, (1993); Blau G., Does a corresponding set of variables for explaining voluntary organizational turnover transfer to explaining voluntary occupational turnover?, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 70, 1, pp. 135-148, (2007); Bobadilla J., Ortega F., Hernando A., Alcala J., Improving collaborative filtering recommender system results and performance using genetic algorithms, Knowledge-based Systems, 24, 8, pp. 1310-1316, (2011); Brocco M., Hauptmann C., Andergassen-Soelva E., Recommender system augmentation of HR databases for team recommendation, 2011 22nd International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications, pp. 554-558, (2011); National longitudinal survey of youth 1979 cohort, 1979-2016 (rounds 1-27).

We argue that links to specific dates can trigger curiosity, increase retention and guide visitors around the venue following new appealing narratives in subsequent visits. The proposal has been evaluated in a pilot study on the collection of the Archaeological Museum of Tripoli (Greece), for which a team of humanities experts wrote a set of diverse narratives about the exhibits. A year-round calendar was crafted so that certain narratives would be more or less relevant on any given day. Expanding on this calendar, personalised recommendations can be made by sorting out those relevant narratives according to personal events and interests recorded in the profiles of the target users. Evaluation of the associations by experts and potential museum visitors shows that the proposed approach can discover meaningful connections, while many others that are more incidental can still contribute to the intended cognitive phenomena. © The Author(s) 2019.","Annual commemorations; context awareness; cultural heritage; historical events; knowledge modelling; personal events; recommender systems","Recommender systems; Semantics; Annual commemorations; Context- awareness; Cultural heritages; historical events; Knowledge modelling; personal events; Museums","","","","","European Union?s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; Galician Regional Government; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (693150); Ministerio de Educación Superior, Ciencia y Tecnología, República Dominicana, MESCYT, (TIN2017-87604-R); Atlantic Research Center for Information and Communication Technologies, AtlantTIC; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","Funding text 1: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work has been funded by CrossCult: ‘Empowering reuse of digital cultural heritage in context-aware crosscuts of European history’, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no. 693150.

One of the highly used approaches for understanding the mobility of individuals is to detect staypoints from trajectories. Although offline detection of staypoints fits best for long-Term planning, some applications require online staypoint detection from trajectories, like online recommendation systems. Latency plays an important role here. In this paper, we propose a stream-based approach for staypoint detection, which can be realized by applying a Data Stream Management System. We claim that the proposed approach can detect staypoints with low latency from the high-frequency location update streams. To evaluate our approach, we compare it with a batch-based approach on real data from an indoor tracking system and Geolife dataset. The results demonstrate that the online approach detects staypoints with much lower latency compared to traditional approaches like offline and batch processing. Moreover, we prove that the accuracy of the stream-based approach is similar to the batch-based approach. © 2021 IEEE.","Latency of staypoint detection; Online staypoint detection; Trajectory stream processing","Batch data processing; Data streams; Location; Online systems; Data stream management systems; High frequency HF; Indoor and outdoor locations; Indoor tracking; Location update; Long term planning; Traditional approaches; Train stations; Information management","","","","","","","Zhang D., Et al., Localization Technologies for Indoor Human Tracking, 2010 5th Intl.

It aims to help visitors discover the tangible and intangible cultural heritage of a region through the identification of important points of interest (POIs), while offering a variety of activities and direct engagement with the region’s cultural identity. The diversity and amount of information that may be available through digital means highlight the need for supporting the visitor in selecting which POIs to visit by offering personalized content. In this paper, we present our approach for a recommendation system for an ecomuseum, through its application in the city of Eleusis, Greece. We present the approach from needs to implementation, as well as the results of a preliminary evaluation, showing promising results for its application as an engaging visitor experience for an ecomuseum. We conclude the paper with a wider discussion about personalization in this context and in a cultural heritage context in general. © 2023 by the authors.","digital ecomuseum; mobile application; recommendation system; user experience","","","","","","CREATE, (Τ1EDK-04277); European Union and Greek national funds; Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation; RESEARCH; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This research was cofunded by the European Regional Development Fund of the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH—CREATE—INNOVATE (project code: Τ1EDK-04277).","Hagen P., Weisman D., Manning H., Souza R., Guided Search for e-Commerce, (1999); Otebolaku A.M., Andrade M.T., Context-Aware Personalization Using Neighborhood-Based Context Similarity, Wirel.

Nowadays, mobile assisted guided tours based on recommendation services are used in museums to enhance visitors ’ experience. However, all those systems have been designed to target indoor or outdoor museum visits. Is it feasible to design a system that supports mobile services that connect a museum visit to artworks situated outdoor in the city environment? Is it possible to connect the artworks of a city center to the exhibits of a museum? In this work, we attempt to give a first answer to such questions proposing and implementing a set of services that connects the museum to the city public space. In order to show the strength of the implemented services, we present a basic usage scenario along with a first system evaluation showing positive results. © 2019, Konstantinos Koukoulis, Dimitrios Koukopoulos and Kali Tzortzi.","Combined recommendation; Museum; Public space; Recommendation systems","","","","","","","","Foucault M., Ethics, Subjectivity and Truth: Essential Works of Foucault 1954–1984, 2, (1997); Mason R., Whitehead C., Graham H., The place of art in the public art gallery: a visual sense of place, Making Sense of Place: Multidisciplinary Perspectives, pp. 133-144, (2012); Friman H., A museum without walls, Museum Int., 58, pp. 55-59, (2006); Koukoulis K., Koukopoulos D., Towards the design of a user-friendly and trustworthy mobile system for museums, EuroMed, Nicosia, Cyprus, pp. 792-802, (2016); Bansal J.C., Das K.N., Nagar A., Deep K., Ojha A.K., Soft Computing for Problem Solving, (2019); Pavlidis G., Recommender systems, cultural heritage applications, and the way forward, J.

Here, we propose to explore the biosystematic signal encompassed in the biological form of 152 petrosa from modern populations of wild and domestic sheep landraces/breeds across Western Europe, South-Western Asia and Africa, using high resolution geometric morphometrics (GMM) and the latest development in 3D virtual morphology. We assessed the taxonomic signals among wild and domestic caprine species and sheep landraces. We also explored the effect of sexual dimorphism and ageing at the population scale. Finally, we assessed the influence of climatic factors across the geographic distribution of our dataset using Köppen-Geiger climate categories. We found that the 3D form of petrous bones can accurately separate wild and domestic caprine taxa and that it is not influenced by sexual dimorphism, post-natal ageing or horn bearing. Recent selective breeding has not induced sufficient diversification to allow accurate identification of the different landraces/breeds in sheep; however, both genetic distance and climatic differences across the current distribution in sheep landraces/breeds strongly contribute to petrosum intraspecific variation. Finally, human mediated dispersal of domestic sheep outside their Near Eastern cradle, especially towards Africa, have greatly contributed to the diversification of sheep petrous bone form and shape. We therefore highly recommend systematic 3D surface modelling of archaeological petrosa with preliminary GMM studies to help target and reduce destructive biomolecular studies. © 2022","3D imaging; Bones morphometrics; Domestication; Zooarchaeology","","","","","","ANR-17-CE27-0004; ARCCH; Adebabay Kebede; Bioarchaeology Laboratory; Bonga Agricultural Research Center; Central Laboratory; Evosheep ANR; Fyssen Foundation for Iranian breeds; Guba & Almeha office of Agriculture; Zinash Abedde Lemma; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR; University of Tehran, UT","Funding text 1: This work was funded by the French National Research Agency (EvoSheep- ANR-17-CE27-0004).

However, they are almost simply a collection of algorithms, overlooking the modularization of recommendation algorithms and their usage in practical scenarios. Algorithmic modularization has the following advantages: 1) helps to understand the effectiveness of each algorithm; 2) easily assembles new algorithms with well-performed modules by either drag-and-drop programming or automatic machine learning; 3) enables reinforcement between algorithms since one algorithm may act as a module of another algorithm. To this end, we develop a highly-modularized recommender system - RecStudio, in which any recommendation algorithm is categorized into either a ranker or a retriever. In the RecStudio library, we implement 90 recommendation algorithms with the pure Pytorch, covering both common algorithms in other libraries and complex algorithms involving multiple recommendation models. RecStudio is featured from several perspectives, such as index-supported efficient recommendation and evaluation, GPU-accelerated negative sampling, hyperparameter learning on the validation, and cooperation between the retriever and ranker. RecStudio is also equipped with a web service, where the recommendation pipeline can be quickly established and visually evaluated on selected datasets, and the evaluation results are automatically archived and visualized in a leaderboard.

By analyzing the present situation of archive service of major sports events, especially the analysis of the opposite dependent subjects of service providers and users, we can see that the continuous development of archive services for major sports events will inevitably lead to constant changes in user groups and user needs, guided by the theory of information retrieval, knowledge management, and media effect. According to the service model of archive service of major sports events, the archive service model of specific sports events is constructed. In this paper, four kinds of event recommendation models are applied to the collected marathon event data for experiments. Through experimental comparison, the effectiveness of content-based recommendation algorithm technology in the event network data set is verified, and an algorithm model suitable for marathon event recommendation is obtained. Experiments show that the comprehensive event recommendation model based on term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) text weight and Race2vec entry sequence has the best recommendation performance on marathon event data set. According to the recommendation target of the event and the characteristics of the event data type, we can choose a single or comprehensive recommendation algorithm to build a model to realize the event recommendation.  © 2022 Yi Liu et al.","","Recommender systems; Sports; Text processing; Archive services; Cooperative perception; Data set; Event-based; Management mechanisms; Multi sensor; Perception model; Recommendation algorithms; Service modeling; Sports events; Knowledge management","","","","","","","Haje P., Arystanbaeva A., The role and importance of accounting information system in the context of digitalization, Asian Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities, 5, 1, pp. 64-73, (2019); McKee M., Van Schalkwyk M.C.I., Stuckler D., The second information revolution: Digitalization brings opportunities and concerns for public health, European Journal of Public Health, 29, pp. 3-6, (2019); Shrayberg Y., Volkova K.Y., Features of copyright transformation in the information environment in the age of digitalization, Scientific and Technical Information Processing, 48, 1, pp. 30-37, (2021); Pistunova T., Slabko V., Averina K., Romanchenko I., Babakina O., Vidomenko O., Providing the minds of the out-of-the-box digitalization as the basic component of the information culture of the teacher, Laplage em Revista, 7, 2, pp. 691-696, (2021); Rudakova T., Semikolenova M., Evolution of accounting information model under conditions of changing economic formations and digitalization of the economy, Electronic Markets, 12, 1, pp. 108-115, (2018); Rafisovich Gapsalamov A., Munirovich Akhmetshin E., Rashatovich Sharipov R., Lvovich Vasilev V., Nikolaevna Bochkareva T., Approaches to information security in educational processes in the context of digitalization, TEM Journal, 9, pp. 708-715, (2020); Tuzii J., Healthcare information technology in Italy, critiques and suggestions for European digitalization, Pharmaceuticals, Policy and Law, 19, 3-4, pp. 161-176, (2018); Hofmann E., Sternberg H., Chen H., Pflaum A., Prockl G., Supply Chain Management and Industry 4.0: Conducting research in the digital age, International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 49, 10, pp. 945-955, (2019); Utomo I.G., Darma G.S., Measuring optimization of digital military programs: An innovation of information and communication systems in Industrial Digitalization 4.0, International Research Journal of Engineering, IT and Scientific Research, 6, 2, pp. 39-46, (2020); Karakozov S.D., Ryzhova N.I., Information and education systems in the context of digitalization of education, Journal of Siberian Federal University, 12, 9, pp. 1635-1647, (2019); Dyatlov S.A., Lobanov O.S., The management of regional information space in the conditions of digital economy, Economy of Region, 14, 4, pp. 1194-1206, (2018); Treber S., Lanza G., Transparency in global production networks: Improving disruption management by increased information exchange, Procedia CIRP, 72, pp. 898-903, (2018); Wei Z., Sun L., How to leverage manufacturing digitalization for green process innovation: An information processing perspective, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 121, 5, pp. 1026-1044, (2021); Nesterov A.V., Digitalization of society and the economy: Systematization of personal data in information systems, Scientific and Technical Information Processing, 47, 2, pp. 133-138, (2020); Baek J.Y., Jo A., Yu S.S., Kim T.B., Oh H.J., Development and application of evaluation factors for the digitalization of intangible cultural heritage record information resources, Journal of Korean Society of Archives and Records Management, 19, 3, pp. 123-153, (2019); Lappi T.M., Aaltonen K., Kujala J., Project governance and portfolio management in government digitalization, Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy, 13, 2, pp. 159-196, (2019); Bobylev S.N., Chereshnya O.Y., Kulmala M., Lappalainen H.K., Petaja T., Solov'Eva S.V., Tikunov V.S., Tynkkynen V.-P., Indicators for digitalization of sustainable development goals in PEEX program, Geography, Environment, Sustainability, 11, 1, pp. 145-156, (2018); Martin-Pena M.L., Sanchez-Lopez J.-M., Diaz-Garrido E., Servitization and digitalization in manufacturing: The influence on firm performance, Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, 35, 3, pp. 564-574, (2019); Hulla M.U., Hammer M., Karre H., Ramsauer C., A case study based digitalization training for learning factories, Procedia Manufacturing, 31, pp. 169-174, (2019); Bjorkdahl J., Strategies for digitalization in manufacturing firms, California Management Review, 62, 4, pp. 17-36, (2020); Stoyanova M., Good practices and recommendations for success in construction digitalization, TEM Journal, 9, 1, pp. 42-47, (2020)","China","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","1687725X","","","","English","J.

However, tourists usually need help knowing what to visit and, avoiding time issues, in which order to explore several Points of Interest (POIs). In this field, new technologies can help tourists to improve their experiences and select the visiting path according to personal preferences. Therefore, the employment of Recommender Systems allows the personalization of the experience through the appropriate POIs' selection. Moreover, RSs' analysis could take advantage of contextual information that suits the personalization in the specific environment where the elaboration happens, providing users with even more specific and tailored paths. This paper aims to design personalized visiting paths combining a Context-Aware Recommender System (CARSs) and a mathematical model to maximize the number of visited POIs in the available time. The proposed approach is tested through a prototype, obtaining promising results.  © 2023 IEEE.","Context-Awareness; Cultural Heritage; Machine Learning; Path Recommendation; Recommender System","Machine learning;

Analysis of dance is useful to preserve cultural heritage, make video recommendation systems, and build tutoring systems. To create such a dance analysis application, three aspects of dance analysis must be addressed: (1) segment the dance video to find representative action elements, (2) recognize the detected action elements, and (3) recognize sequences formed by combining action elements according to specific rules. This paper attempts to address the three fundamental problems of dance analysis raised above, with a focus on Indian Classical Dance, em Bharatanatyam. Since dance is driven by music, we use both musical and motion information to extract action elements. The action elements are then recognized using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Finally, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are used to recognize the dance sequence. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Bharatanatyam Dance analysis; Dance segmentation; Machine learning; Multi-modal dance modeling; Posture recognition; Sequence recognition","Historic preservation; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Music; Semantics; Bharatanatyam dance analyse; Dance analysis; Dance segmentation; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Multi-modal; Multi-modal dance modeling; Performance; Posture recognition; Sequence recognition; Hidden Markov models","","","","","Tata Consultancy Services, TCS","The work of the first author is supported by the TCS Research Scholar Program of Tata Consultancy Services of India .","Xu W., Miao Z., Zhang X.-P., Tian Y., A hierarchical spatio-temporal model for human activity recognition, IEEE Trans.

This study uses the logistic regression algorithm based on sigmoid functions to analyze and process the music audio-visual library of a music software and establishes the logistic regression dynamic model, which provides a scientific research method for this complex system. The LPC characteristic coefficient is extracted, and then the logistic regression model of music audio-visual archives resources is established. After completing the model, this study obtains the logistic regression model through a series of experiments, which effectively optimizes the management of music audio-visual archives. The specific experimental conclusions are as follows: through genre classification and emotion classification, users can search more music audio-visual archives resources. The comparison shows that the recommendation effect after filtering by the logistic regression model is better than that of the nonstandard collaborative filtering recommendation system. Finally, after practical applications, it is concluded that the model based on the logistic regression algorithm has made a good optimization conclusion for the resource management of music audio-visual archives.  © 2022 Chongbo Deng.","","Audio acoustics; Big data; Collaborative filtering; Music; Natural resources management; Regression analysis; Audio-visual; Logistic regression algorithms; Logistic Regression modeling; Management method; Optimization method; Resource management; Resources optimization; Sigmoid function; Video management; Visual library; Resource allocation","","","","","","","Nickoo M., Sophia S., Svetlana P., Joshua H., Nadege W., Clark R., Habib Z., Longo C., Their words: Children's perspectives on an el sistema music program's effects on their well-being, Progress in Community Health Partnerships: Research, Education, and Action, 13, 4, (2019); Matthews H., Persuasion, representation, and emotional heightening:the ethical implications of music as a creative practice in the contemporary social documentary, Music, Sound, and the Moving Image, 15, 1, (2021); Aydin-Duzgit S., Lyndon C.S., Popular music and multimodal critical discourse Analysis.

In response to this trend, companies have begun using product service systems (PSS), business models that provide customers not only with tangible products but also with intangible services. Moreover, with the increasing use of smart devices, services providers can offer customized services to customers based on user-generated data with smart product service systems (Smart PSS). Despite extensive research on Smart PSS framework, few of these frameworks treated customer as an active data producer, which means producing data for the Smart PSS actively. Additionally, most of them proposed a general solution instead of a personalized one. To bridge the research gap, this study proposed a method that includes: (1) unsupervised natural language processing (NLP) methods to analyze user-provided data. (2) a recommendation system integrating deep learning to offer customers with personalized solutions. Thus, the role of customers is not only a service receiver but also an active data producer and forms a value co-creation process with service providers. A case study of tourist recommendation validate the benefits of proposed method. The main contribution of this research is to develop a personalized smart PSS method which could achieve a win-win situation for all players in this method. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Machine learning; Natural language processing; Recommendation system; Smart product service system","Deep learning; Natural language processing systems; Recommender systems; Sales; Customized services; General solutions; NAtural language processing; Personalized recommendation systems; Productservice system (PSS); Service provider; Tangible product; Value co creations; Learning systems","","","","","Artificial Intelligence for Intelligent Manufacturing Systems Research Center; National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, (109-2634-F-007-021); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (109-2628-E-007-002-MY3)","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan for financially supporting this research under Contract no.

In these collections, the curators are responsible for organizing the artworks seeking a delicate balance between emotion and reason. Given an initial artwork, however, a visitor is likely to select and admire a set of related artworks that match her interests. This setting can be seen as a recommendation problem in the art domain. Although image recommendation systems have been previously developed, considering the artwork nature is a fundamental aspect when designing a recommender system in this domain. Thus, we propose a hybrid recommendation approach that combines deep autoencoders with a social influence graph in order to capture the visual aspects and context of artworks (represented by images). These mechanisms inform the generation of rankings of related artworks. In this context, we report on a case-study with a group of art experts who assessed the rankings of artworks recommended by our approach. Although preliminary, the results showed a better precision than traditional strategies based solely on image features or metadata. Furthermore, the recommendations exhibited diversity properties, avoiding typical over-specialization problems of content-based techniques. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artwork; Deep autoencoder; Ontology; Recommender systems","Learning systems; Artwork; Auto encoders; Deep autoencoder; Hybrid approach; Hybrid recommendation approaches; Influence graph; Ontology's; Social influence; Visual aspects; Visual context; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Amatriain X., Jaimes A., Oliver N., Pujol J.M., Data mining methods for recommender systems, Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 39-71, (2011); Aumont J., The Image, (1997); Banerjee M., Capozzoli M., McSweeney L., Sinha D., Beyond kappa: A review of interrater agreement measures, Canad.

Acquisition of data from pictures, archives, communication systems, electronic health records, online documents, radiology reports and clinical records of different styles with specific numerical information has given rise to the concept of multimodality and the need for machine learning and deep learning techniques in the analysis of the healthcare system. Medical data play a vital role in medical education and diagnosis; determining dependency between distinct modalities is essential. This paper gives a gist of current radiology medical data analysis techniques and their various approaches and frameworks for representation and classification. A brief outline of the existing medical multimodal data processing work is presented. The main objective of this study is to spot gaps in the surveyed area and list future tasks and challenges in radiology. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (or PRISMA) guidelines were incorporated in this study for effective article search and to investigate several relevant scientific publications. The systematic review was carried out on multimodal medical data analysis and highlighted advantages, limitations and strategies. The inherent benefit of multimodality in the medical domain powered with artificial intelligence has a significant impact on the performance of the disease diagnosis frameworks. © 2022 by the author(s).","AI; Big data analysis; Clinical recommendation system; Data classification; Data extraction; Data visualization; Multimodality; Structured and unstructured healthcare data","","","","","","Department of Information Technology; National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, NITK","We would like to thank the Department of Information Technology, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, for providing us with the resources for carrying out this research.

Video tag recommender systems are artificial intelligence-enabled frameworks that strive for recommending precise tags for videos. Extant video tag recommender systems are uninterpretable, which leads to distrust of the recommendation outcome, hesitation in tag adoption and difficulty in the system debugging process. This study aims at constructing an interpretable and novel video tag recommender system to assist video-sharing platform users in tagging their newly uploaded videos. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed interpretable video tag recommender system is a multimedia deep learning framework composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which receives texts and images as inputs. The interpretability of the proposed system is realized through layer-wise relevance propagation. Findings: The case study and user study demonstrate that the proposed interpretable multimedia CNN model could effectively explain its recommended tag to users by highlighting keywords and key patches that contribute the most to the recommended tag. Moreover, the proposed model achieves an improved recommendation performance by outperforming state-of-the-art models. Practical implications: The interpretability of the proposed recommender system makes its decision process more transparent, builds users’ trust in the recommender systems and prompts users to adopt the recommended tags. Through labeling videos with human-understandable and accurate tags, the exposure of videos to their target audiences would increase, which enhances information technology (IT) adoption, customer engagement, value co-creation and precision marketing on the video-sharing platform. Originality/value: The proposed model is not only the first explainable video tag recommender system but also the first explainable multimedia tag recommender system to the best of our knowledge. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Convolutional neural network; Interpretable AI; Machine learning; Multimedia; Recommender system; User-generated content","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71801217, 71872080, 72022007); Tsinghua University, THU, (2019THZWJC12)","The authors appreciate the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their detailed and constructive comments.

Emotion-based music recovery will have extraordinary potential in catering nowadays, digital music archives quickly extending in the developing smartphones and ubiquitous environments. Many types of research are conducted to improve the music recommendation to users based on their emotions. Human emotions have much difficulty due to the subjective perception of emotions and accuracy challenges. In this paper, we need to solve the problem of recommending songs to the user based on his selection if it was bad, sad, or angry mood by using our system we will recommend to the user songs from pleasant mood to try changing him to the good mood and track if user listen to this song or scaped it. Our new algorithm, ""Hybrid emotion-based music recommendation system,"" will recommend music to the next level, generating playlist which suits and matches your mood of listening to music. The user can try three choices to get the emotion by using face recognition, choosing three colors, and using the arousal map to select the emotion will appear to users then recommended songs according to his status we merge the output of the system to detect the right mood. Our new system has good novelty and diversity of songs recommended to users and changes the user's mood to the pleasure. At our experimental results We are using precision, recall and f-measure accuracy equations to calculate the effective of our system. To gain high results we apply different experiments detect users' emotions like using face only, colors, arousal map then let users select to types of emotion like face and colors or colors and arousal and finally apply hybrid emotions system. Every time we measure the accuracy of the results. Based on the experiments results using our new hybrid emotions model is best accuracy in surprised, anger, natural and relaxed. While user's emotion sadness using face. arousal map has high accuracy with happy emotions. © 2021 Little Lion Scientific.

Based on the strategic main line of ""advantages,""it proposes the design ideas and overall framework of the smart tourism service model based on the network platform, including the smart tourism information interactive service model, the element collaborative service model, and the value cocreation service model. The comparison of recommendation results shows that the recommendation error of the genetically improved generalized regression neural network algorithm is reduced, and the recommendation accuracy is better than that of the unimproved generalized regression neural network algorithm. In the recommendation scenario of click-through rate recommendation, the existing recommendation models are difficult to meet the functions of memory and generalization at the same time and cannot fully mine and combine low-level features, and the model parameters of the deep learning model are difficult to learn under the high-dimensional sparse data set of the recommendation system. To solve the problem of generalization, this paper proposes a deep CTR recommendation model based on the gradient boosting tree and factorization machine. It can fully mine low-level feature information and automatically realize low-level feature combination, which can better learn model parameters on high-dimensional sparse data sets, and the recommendation results are no longer overgeneralized. In this paper, simulation experiments are carried out on the data set, and the related recommendation models are compared. The experimental results show that the model proposed in this paper achieves better results in both the AUC (area under ROC curve) evaluation index and the cross-entropy evaluation index.  © 2022 Shuangqin Lin.","","Algorithms;

This paper proposed an interconnected and interoperable smart service network to co-create interactive post-pandemic dining experiences that are beneficial to both the customers and restaurant operators by broadcasting personalised location-based promotional messages aggregated from external contextual information collected via sensors attuned to customer dining habits; shape expectations via ambient, sensory information, and images; interact with customers and assist their dining choices by artificial intelligence recommendation systems; and can cook and deliver meals by automated robotic technologies. The theoretical contribution of this paper focuses on developing a smart dining experience framework which optimises the interaction among smart technology, service staff, restaurant managers, customers, and their collective experience. Restaurant managers’ awareness and integration of smart technologies and smart services can enhance the overall customer dining experiences and post-dining feedback for continuous real-time improvement. © KOSIME, ASIALICS, STEPI 2020.","dining experience; restaurant service; smart network; Smart technology; value co-creation","","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (108-2410-H-214-008)","This research was partially supported by a grant from the Ministry of Science and Technology Taiwan, [Project ID Number: 108-2410-H-214-008].","Ahn J.A., Seo S., Consumer responses to interactive restaurant self-service technology (IRSST): The role of gadget-loving propensity, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 74, pp. 109-121, (2018); Alsaadi E., Tubaishat A., Internet of things: Features, challenges, and vulnerabilities, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Information Technology, 4, 1, pp. 1-13, (2015); Ateke B.W., Ogonu G.C., Ishmael E.C., Perceived justice initiatives and customers’ post-complaint satisfaction in the fastfood industry, Journal of Marketing and Consumer Research, 14, pp. 117-125, (2015); Bamburry D., Drones: Designed for product delivery, Design Management Review, 26, 1, pp. 40-48, (2015); Barber N., Goodman R.J., Goh B.K., Restaurant consumers repeat patronage: A service quality concern, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 30, 2, pp. 329-336, (2011); Beldona S., Buchanan N., Miller B.L., Exploring the promise of e-tablet restaurant menus, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 26, 3, pp. 367-382, (2014); Bernard D., Lockwood A., Pantelidis I., Alcott P., Food and beverage management, (2012); Bethapudi A., The role of ICT in tourism industry, Journal of Applied Economics and Business, 1, 4, pp. 67-79, (2013); Bin Ayob M.F., Ibrahim M., The effects of digital business adoption on hotel performance: A conceptual framework for small-and-medium-sized hotels in Malaysia, CAUTHE 2016: The Changing Landscape of Tourism and Hospitality: The Impact of Emerging Markets and Emerging Destinations, pp. 651-658, (2016); Biswas D., Szocs C., Chacko R., Wansink B., Shining light on atmospherics: How ambient light influences food choices, Journal of Marketing Research, 54, 1, pp. 111-123, (2017); Boes K., Buhalis D., Inversini A., Smart tourism destinations: Ecosystems for tourism destination competitiveness, International Journal of Tourism Cities, 2, 2, pp. 108-124, (2016); Buhalis D., Amaranggana A., Smart tourism destinations enhancing tourism experience through personalisation of services, Information and communication technologies in tourism 2015, pp. 377-389, (2015); Buhalis D., Leung R., Smart hospitality—interconnectivity and interoperability towards an ecosystem, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 71, pp. 41-50, (2018); Buhalis D., O'Connor P., Information communication technology revolutionizing tourism, Tourism Recreation Research, 30, 3, pp. 7-16, (2005); Cheong S.N., Yeong M.H.T., Neoh J.J., Teh C.Y., Yap W.J., Enriching dining experience with the multi-touchable entertainment applications, 2010 International conference on Science and Social Research (CSSR 2010), (2010); Cohen B., The “WOW” effect: How one restaurateur continues to delight customers, The Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 38, 2, pp. 74-81, (1997); Dabholkar P.A., Spaid B.I., Service failure and recovery in using technology-based self-service: Effects on user attributions and satisfaction, The Service Industries Journal, 32, 9, pp. 1415-1432, (2012); Dan S., Howard M., Managing the delayed service encounter: The role of employee action and customer prior experience, Journal of Services Marketing, 12, 3, pp. 195-208, (1998); De Vries J., Roy D., De Koster R., Worth the wait?

Therefore, a recommendation not only helps you find the best probable product according to your preference but also increases the efficacy to find the product for you in less time interval. Artificial neural network has been producing a tremendous result in the practical solutions like image classification, speech recognitions and various AI problems. The use of neural network to build recommendations system can also be used as an auto encoder in various sector. The neural network contains many layers and each layer contains many perceptron which holds the weight. While the network gets trained, the weights of each perception are optimized and get adjusted. Building a simple neural network model for predicting recommendations with high accuracy is the objective of this work. The dataset used in this recommendations model is contributed by the Movie-lens archive. Manipulating the data into a right form and format is the most important part of the model. The whole work is performed, experimented and evaluated in python as it consists of many predefined useful libraries. The result of the recommender model is evaluated by finding the Hit-Ratio. The Hit-ratio obtained by this model is 87. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.","Implicit data, Movie predictions; Latent space; Matrix factorization; Neural-network","","","","","","","","Xiangnan H., Lizi L., Hanwang Z., Liqiang N., Xia H., Tat S.C., Neural collaborative filtering, (2017); Ting B., Ji-Rong W., Jun Z., Wayne X.Z., A neural collaborative filtering model with interaction-based neighbourhood, In Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 1979-1982, (2017); Liu Y.S., A novel deep hybrid recommender system based on auto-encoder with neural collaborative filtering, Big Data Min Anal, 1, 3, pp. 211-221, (2018); Chen W.F., Joint neural collaborative filtering for recommender systems, ACM Trans Inf Syst (TOIS), 37, pp. 1-30, (2019); Li E.C., Learning binary codes with neural collaborative filtering for efficient recommendation systems, Knowl-Based Syst, 172, pp. 64-75, (2019); Gao X.W., Context-aware QoS prediction with neural collaborative filtering for Internet-of-Things services, IEEE Internet Things J, 7, 5, pp. 4532-4542, (2019); Krishnan A., Ashish S., Hari S., An adversarial approach to improve long-tail performance in neural collaborative filtering, In: Proceedings of the 27Th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 1491-1494, (2018); Khaki L.W., Predicting yield performance of parents in plant breeding: A neural collaborative filtering approach, PLoS ONE, 15, 5, (2020); Li Z.Y., Bin G., Yan L., Yao J., Yi O., Zhiwen Y., Commercial site recommendation based on neural collaborative filtering, In: Ubicomp '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM International Joint Conference and 2018 International Symposium on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Wearable Computers, pp. 138-141, (2018); Liu Y.S., A neural collaborative filtering method for identifying miRNA-disease associations, Neurocomputing, 422, pp. 176-185, (2021); Ren Z., Xia N., Andrew S.L., Huzefa R., Grade prediction with neural collaborative filtering, .

However, their original purpose has been waning due to inappropriate language, fabricated information, and the lack of evidence that supports petitions. The lack of deliberation in online petitions has influenced other users, deteriorating the platform to a degree that good petitions are seldom generated. Therefore, this study designs interventions that empower users to create deliberative petitions. We conducted user research to observe users' writing behavior in online petitions and identified causes of non-deliberative petitions. Based on our findings, we propose ThinkWrite, a new interactive app promoting user deliberation. The app includes six main features: a gamified learning process, a writing recommendation system, a guiding interface for self-construction, tailored AI for self-revision, short-cuts for easy archiving of evidence, and a citizen-collaborative page. Finally, the efficacy of the app is demonstrated through user surveys and in-depth interviews. © 2022 ACM.","Citizen Participation; Deliberation; Design intervention; e-Petition; Online Petition; Public policy","Learning systems; Public policy; Citizen's participations; Deliberation; Design intervention; E-petition; Learning process; Online petition; Study design; User research; User surveys; Writing behavior; Surveys","","","","","Venture Research Program; Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, KAIST, (N11210094)","This work was supported by Venture Research Program grant funded by KAIST (N11210094)).","Anduiza E., Anduiza Perea E., James Jensen M., Jorba L., Digital Media and Political Engagement Worldwide: A Comparative Study, (2012); Barata G., Gama S., Jorge J., Goncalves D., Improving Participation and Learning with Gamification, Proceedings of the First International Conference on Gameful Design, Research, and Applications (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) (Gamification '13, pp. 10-17, (2013); Berg J., Political Participation in the Form of Online Petitions: A Comparison of Formal and Informal Petitioning, Int.

Recommender Systems offer the automatic tools to guide users in their decision process, by maximizing the adherence of the proposed contents with the particular preferences of every single user. However, traditional recommendation paradigms suffer from several drawbacks which are exacerbated in Cultural Heritage scenarios, due to the extremely wide range of users behaviors, which may also depend on their different educational backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid recommender system which combines the four most common recommendation paradigms, namely collaborative filtering, popularity-, knowledge-, and content-based, according to different hybridization strategies. Experimental evaluation shows the versatility of the hybrid recommender with respect to the other paradigms adopted individually. © 2021 IEEE.","cultural heritage; Recommender systems","Collaborative filtering; Automatic tools; Content-based; Cultural heritages; Decision process; Heritage promotion; Hybrid recommender systems; Hybridisation; Knowledge based; Single users; User behaviors; Recommender systems","","","","","VASARI; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (2511, PNR 2015-2020)","This research is partially funded by the Project VASARI of Italian MIUR (PNR 2015-2020, DD MIUR n. 2511).","Aggarwal C.C., Recommender Systems -The Textbook., 1, (2016); Ferraro P., Lo Re G., Designing Ontology-Driven Recommender Systems for Tourism., pp. 339-352, (2014); Catarci T., Leotta F., Marrella A., Mecella M., Sora D., Cottone P., Lo Re G., Morana M., Ortolani M., Agate V., Meschino G.R., Pecoraro G., Pergola G., Your friends mention it.

POI categories (e.g. restaurant, hotel, museum etc.) play a prominent role in several location-based applications such as social media, navigation, recommender systems, geographic information retrieval tools, and travel-related services. The majority of user queries in these applications center around POI categories. For instance, people often search for the closest pub or the best value-for-money hotel in an area. To provide valid answers to such queries, accurate and consistent information on POI categories is an essential requirement. Nevertheless, category-based annotations of POIs are often missing. The task of annotating unlabeled POIs in terms of their categories — known as POI classification — is commonly achieved by means of machine learning (ML) models, often referred to as classifiers. Central to this task is the extraction of known features from pre-labeled POIs in order to train the classifiers and, then, use the trained models to categorize unlabeled POIs. However, the set of features used in this process can heavily influence the classification results. Research on defining the influence of different features on the categorization of POIs is currently lacking. This paper contributes a study of feature importance for the classification of unlabeled POIs into categories. We define five feature sets that address operation based, review-based, topic-based, neighborhood-based, and visual attributes of POIs. Contrary to existing studies that predominantly use multi-class classification approaches, and in order to assess and rank the influence of POI features on the categorization task, we propose both a multi-class and a binary classification approach. These, respectively, predict the place category among a specified set of POI categories, or indicate whether a POI belongs to a certain category. Using POI data from Amsterdam and Athens to implement and evaluate our study approach, we show that operation based features, such as opening or visiting hours throughout the day, are the most important place category predictors. Moreover, we demonstrate that the use of feature combinations, as opposed to the use of individual features, improves the classification performance by an average of 15%, in terms of F1-score. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Classification; Feature extraction; Feature importance; POI categories; Point of interest","Amsterdam [North Holland]; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Greece; Netherlands; North Holland; Classifiers; Learning systems; Location based services; Recommender systems; Search engines; Binary Classification Approach; Classification performance; Classification results; Feature combination; Geographic information retrieval; Individual features; Location-based applications; Multi-class classification; accuracy assessment; assessment method; classification; GIS; hotel industry; research work; satellite data; spatial analysis; Classification (of information)","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (874724)","","Blei D.M., Ng A.Y., Jordan M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Chawla N.V., Bowyer K.W., Hall L.O., Kegelmeyer W.P., Smote: Synthetic minority over-sampling technique, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 16, pp. 321-357, (2002); Choi S.J., Song H.J., Park S.B., Lee S.J., A poi categorization by composition of onomastic and contextual information, 2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT), 2, pp. 38-45, (2020); Cocos A., Callison-Burch C., The language of place: Semantic value from geospatial context, Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Volume 2, 2, pp. 99-104, (2020); Ding D., Zhang M., Pan X., Wu D., Pu P., Geographical feature extraction for entities in location-based social networks, Proceedings of the 2018 World Wide Web Conference, pp. 833-842, (2020); Fu C., McKenzie G., Frias-Martinez V., Stewart K., Identifying spatiotemporal urban activities through linguistic signatures, (2018); Fu K., Chen Z., Lu C.-T., Streetnet: preference learning with convolutional neural network on urban crime perception, Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, pp. 269-278, (2020); Funke S., Storandt S., Automatic tag enrichment for points-of-interest in open street map, International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems, pp. 3-18, (2020); Giannopoulos G., Alexis K., Kostagiolas N., Skoutas D., Classifying points of interest with minimum metadata, Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Location-based Recommendations, pp. 1-4, (2020); Giannopoulos G., Meimaris M., Learning domain driven and semantically enriched embeddings for poi classification, Proceedings of the 16th International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases, pp. 214-217, (2020); Janowicz K., McKenzie G., Hu Y., Zhu R., Gao S., Using semantic signatures for social sensing in urban environments, Mobility Patterns, Big Data and Transport Analytics, pp. 31-54, (2019); Jenkins A., Croitoru A., Crooks A.T., Stefanidis A., Crowdsourcing a collective sense of place, PLoS One, 11, (2016); Jiang S., Alves A., Rodrigues F., Ferreira J., Pereira F.C., Mining point-of-interest data from social networks for urban land use classification and disaggregation, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 53, pp. 36-46, (2015); Koster H.R., Pasidis I., van Ommeren J., Shopping externalities and retail concentration: Evidence from dutch shopping streets, Journal of Urban Economics, 114, (2019); Li X., Zhang C., Li W., Ricard R., Meng Q., Zhang W., Assessing streetlevel urban greenery using google street view and a modified green view index, Urban Forestry & Urban Greening, 14, pp. 675-685, (2015); Liu L., Silva E.A., Wu C., Wang H., A machine learning-based method for the large-scale evaluation of the qualities of the urban environment, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 65, pp. 113-125, (2017); Lu X., Yu Z., Liu C., Liu Y., Xiong H., Guo B., Inferring lifetime status of point-of-interest: A multitask multiclass approach, ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD), 14, pp. 1-27, (2020); Marti P., Serrano-Estrada L., Nolasco-Cirugeda A., Social media data: Challenges, opportunities and limitations in urban studies, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 74, pp. 161-174, (2019); McKenzie G., Adams B., A data-driven approach to exploring similarities of tourist attractions through online reviews, Journal of Location Based Services, 12, pp. 94-118, (2018); McKenzie G., Janowicz K., Adams B., Weighted multi-attribute matching of user-generated points of interest, Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, pp. 440-443, (2020); McKenzie G., Janowicz K., Gao S., Gong L., How where is when?

By relying on the (Formula presented.) commonsense reasoning framework, the system exploits the spatial structure of the Plutchik’s “wheel of emotions” to organize the stories according to their extracted emotions. The process of emotion extraction, reasoning, and suggestion is triggered by an app, called GAMGame, and integrated with the sensemaking engine. Following the framework of Citizen Curation, the system allows classifying and suggesting stories encompassing cultural items able to evoke not only the very same emotions of already experienced or preferred museum objects but also novel items sharing different emotional stances and, therefore, able to break the filter bubble effect and open the users’ view toward more inclusive and empathy-based interpretations of cultural content. The system has been designed tested, in the context of the H2020EU SPICE project (Social cohesion, Participation, and Inclusion through Cultural Engagement), in cooperation with the community of the d/Deaf and on the collection of the Gallery of Modern Art (GAM) in Turin.

An important recently addressed variant of the problem not only considers the distance/proximity aspect, but also desires semantically diverse locations in the answer-set. For instance, rather than picking several close-by attractions with similar features—e.g., restaurants with similar menus; museums with similar art exhibitions—a tourist may be more interested in a result set that could potentially provide more diverse types of experiences, for as long as they are within an acceptable distance from a given (current) location. Towards that goal, in this work we propose a novel approach to efficiently retrieve a path that will maximize the semantic diversity of the visited PoIs that are within distance limits along a given road network. Our approach allows to specify both a start and terminal location to return a (non-necessarily shortest) path that maximizes diversity rather than only minimizing travel cost, thus providing ample applications in tourist route recommendation systems. We introduce a novel indexing structure—the Diversity Aggregated R-tree, based on which we devise efficient algorithms to generate the answer-set—i.e., the recommended locations among a set of given PoIs—relying on a greedy searching strategy. Our experimental evaluations conducted on real datasets demonstrate the benefits of the proposed methodology over the baseline alternative approaches. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Diversity; Indexing; Road networks; Trajectories","Decision trees; Indexing (of information); Location based services; Museums; Roads and streets; Semantic Web; Semantics; Telecommunication services; 'current; Answer set; Diverse locations; Diversity; Indexing; Location-based services; Police station; Proximal Points; Road network; Short-path; Location","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CCF-1637541, SWIFT 203024)","Dr. Züfle is supported by National Science Foundation AitF Grant CCF-1637541.

A domain which could greatly benefit of this innovation is the one regarding Location-based and/or Touristic Recommender Systems, where the user receives suggestions based on his/her past liked items. In this work, we consider the use of neural embeddings weighted using Smooth-Inverse Frequency (SIF) to detect semantic similarities in textual descriptions found in a large graph database covering Italian cultural Points of Interests (POIs). Of all detected similar pairs on a national scale, 19% are composed by POIs that do not belong to the same ontological category, highlighting the potential neural embeddings have to match POIs beyond the categories they have been assigned to. However, since text descriptions also contain references to the places where POIs are found, similarities can be detected among POIs sharing the same location, especially in the case of low-frequency geographical terms. While this may be desirable, in some cases, it may harm location-aware applications, as POIs positions are already known. By comparing city names occurrence probabilities both in the full text corpus and in location-constrained sub-corpora, we observed probability shifts, on average, of 232%. This suggests that, for the specific case of location-aware services, SIF-weighted neural embeddings should use location-constrained sub-corpora for term occurrence probability computation in order to efficiently remove uninteresting information. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Location-based services; Neural embeddings; Semantic analysis","Embeddings; Location; Natural language processing systems; Probability; Recommender systems; Semantics; Telecommunication services; Content similarity; Cultural heritages; Embeddings; Location based; Location-based services; Neural embedding; Novel applications; Semantic analysis; Semantic similarity; Similarity measure; Location based services","","","","","","","Arora S., Liang Y., Ma T., A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for sentence embeddings, Proceedings of the 5Th International Conference on Learning Representations, (2017); Baeza-Yates R., Ribeiro-Neto B., Et al., Modern Information Retrieval, vol. 463, ACM Press New York, (1999); Borras J., Moreno A., Valls A., Intelligent tourism recommender systems: A survey, Expert Syst.

Most of these portals were developed with technolo- gies from the syntactic web era, i.e. containing HTML pages with plain text that can be indexed by search en- gines, but without additional metadata and annotations of concepts belonging to knowledge organization sys- tems that would facilitate the task of thematic special- ized search engines. This paper proposes a method for recommending the knowledge organization systems that are better adjusted for the contents of a web portal and the use of these systems for the semantic annota- tion of the contents. To check the feasibility of the pro- posed method, we have applied it to the enrichment of a web portal created in the nineties that hosts a virtual catalogue of the works performed by the painter Goya. Thanks to the proposed method, we have been able to recommend knowledge organization system titled List of Subject Headings for Public Libraries because of its closeness with the portal content. In addition, two thirds of the web pages in Spanish were annotated with con- cepts belonging to this model. Although the accuracy of the mapping between the recognized entities in the text and the concepts of the model is not perfect, it con- stitutes a good base to allow web portal administrators to refine later this annotation. © 2021 Prensas Universitarias de Zaragoza.

Since the aforementioned models lack the notion of context, they cannot work with temporal information that is often present in recommendations for cultural environments (e.g., special exhibitions or events). In this respect, the current work aims to enhance the capabilities of large language models through a fine-tuning process that incorporates contextual information and user instructions. The resulting models are expected to be capable of providing personalized recommendations that are aligned with user preferences and desires. More specifically, Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4, a knowledge-based large language model is fine-tuned and turned into a context-aware recommendation system, adapting its suggestions based on user input and specific contextual factors such as location, time of visit, and other relevant parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated through certain user studies, which ensure an improved user experience and engagement within the museum environment. © 2023 by the authors.","context awareness; cultural heritage; GPT-4; large language models; museum; personalization; recommender systems","","","","","","","","Zhang Q., Lu J., Jin Y., Artificial intelligence in recommender systems, Complex Intell.

SMBII Museum in Palembang has a remarkable decrease of visitors up to 90%. A strategy is needed to increase museum visits and enable educational and tourism roles in a pandemic situation. This paper evaluates the machine learning model for exhibition recommendations given to visitors through virtual tour applications. Exploring unfamiliar museum exhibitions to visitors through virtual museum applications will be tedious. If virtual collections are ancient and do not display any interest, they will quickly lead to boredom and reluctance to explore virtual museums. For this reason, an effective method is needed to provide suggestions or recommendations that meet the interests of visitors based on the profiles of museum visitors, making it easier for visitors to find exciting exhibition rooms for learning and tourism. Machine learning has proven its effectiveness for predictions and recommendations. This study evaluates several machine learning classifiers for exhibition recommendations and development of virtual tour applications that applied machine learning classifiers with the best performance based on the model evaluation. The experimental results show that the KNN model performs best for exhibition recommendations with cross-validation accuracy = 89.09% and F-Measure = 90.91%. The SUS usability evaluation on the exhibition recommender feature in the virtual tour application of SMBII museum shows average score of 85.83. The machine learning-based recommender feature usability is acceptable, making it easy and attractive for visitors to find an exhibition that might match their interests. © 2022.

However, with their inherently recursive message propagation among neighboring nodes, existing GNN-based CF models may generate indistinguishable and inaccurate user (item) representations due to the over-smoothing and noise effect with low-pass Laplacian smoothing operators. In addition, the recursive information propagation with the stacked aggregators in the entire graph structures may result in poor scalability in practical applications. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a simple and effective collaborative filtering model (SimRec) that marries the power of knowledge distillation and contrastive learning. In SimRec, adaptive transferring knowledge is enabled between the teacher GNN model and a lightweight student network, to not only preserve the global collaborative signals, but also address the over-smoothing issue with representation recalibration. Empirical results on public datasets show that SimRec archives better efficiency while maintaining superior recommendation performance compared with various strong baselines.

In the traditional sequence recommendation model, we mainly utilize the action sequence information to model the representations of items and users. However, the fashion categories and features of items change much more frequently in our task, and the bias caused by the popularity will greatly affect the representations learning for the users and items. In this work, our team, termed THLUO, devise a model, which injects the spatiotemporal features of each item in sessions to alleviate the bias problem and capture the latest fashion trend information hiding in the session. In more detail, we proposed a two stages model, which includes retrieval and re-ranking. In the retrieval stage, we adapt the positions and timestamp features into the item-CF model to eliminate the bias caused by the popularity. In the re-ranking stage, we not only adapt traditional feature engineering but also used the enhanced features created by neural net works and fusion them as inputs of LightGBM for final prediction. After careful experiments, our model's result archive an outstanding score of 0.2062 in mean reciprocal rank metrics in the test dataset, finally ranked fifth in the competition.  © 2022 ACM.","Boosting; Deep Learning; Feature Engineering; Neural Networks; Recommender Systems; RecSys Challenge","Deep learning; Statistical tests; Action sequences; Boosting; Deep learning; Feature engineerings; Neural-networks; Online retails; Public dataset; Re-ranking; Recsys challenge; Sequence informations; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Burges C.J.C., From ranknet to lambdarank to lambdamart: An overview, Learning, 11, 23-581, (2010); Chen T., Guestrin C., XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system, Proceedings of The 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (San Francisco, California, USA), pp. 785-794, (2016); Deotte C., Liu B., Schifferer B., Titericz G., GPU accelerated boosted trees and deep neural networks for better recommender systems, RecSysChallenge’21: Proceedings of The Recommender Systems Challenge, 2021, pp. 7-14, (2021); Grover A., Leskovec J., Node2vec: Scalable feature learning for networks, Proceedings of The 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (San Francisco, California, USA), pp. 855-864, (2016); He X., Liao L., Zhang H., Nie L., Hu X., Chua T.-S., Neural collaborative filtering, Proceedings of The 26th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 173-182, (2017); Ke G., Meng Q., Finley T., Wang T., Chen W., Ma W., Ye Q., Liu T.-Y., LightGBM: A highly efficient gradient boosting decision tree, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 30, (2017); Koren Y., Factorization meets the neighborhood: A multifaceted collaborative filtering model, Proceedings of The 14th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 426-434, (2008); Le Q., Mikolov T., Distributed representations of sentences and documents, Proceedings of The 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 32, pp. 1188-1196, (2014); Melville P., Mooney R.J., Nagarajan R., Et al., Content-boosted collaborative filtering for improved recommendations, Aaai/Iaai, 23, pp. 187-192, (2002); Mikolov T., Chen K., Corrado G.S., Dean J., Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space, ICLR, (2013); Tao Z., Liu X., Xia Y., Wang X., Yang L., Huang X., Chua T.-S., Self-supervised Learning for Multimedia Recommendation, IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 2022, pp. 1-10, (2022); Tao Z., Wang X., He X., Huang X., Chua T.-S., 2020, Information Processing & Management, 57, 6; Tao Z., Wei Y., Wang X., He X., Huang X., Chua T.-S., 2020, Information Processing & Management, 57, 5; Volkovs M., Perez F., Cheng Z., Sun J., Norouzi S., Jankiewicz P., Rho B., User engagement modeling with deep learning and language models, RecSysChallenge’21: Proceedings of The Recommender Systems Challenge, 2021, pp. 22-27, (2021); Zhang J., Dong Y., Wang Y., Tang J., Ding M., ProNE: Fast and Scalable Network Representation Learning, pp. 4278-4284, (2019)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","16th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, RecsysChallenge 2022","22 September 2022","Seattle","182831","","978-145039856-5","","","English","ACM Int.

This paper proposes a museum object recommendation method based on collaborative filtering, which simplifies the display design, improves the recommendation effect, and alleviates the scalability problem. Firstly, the algorithm of recommendation system combines the advantages of memory collaborative filtering and uses smoothing processing to improve the efficiency of recommendation and achieve the best consistency. Then, the cross-domain collaborative filtering rating matrix generation model is used to establish the correlation between multiple rating matrices by finding the shared hidden clustering rating matrix, which also improves the recommendation effect. Finally, the conclusion shows that we can use single user behavior data such as forgetting mechanism to recommend to users. SVD makes full use of the interaction data of various behaviors, and NMF algorithm makes full use of the data of various user behaviors, which can effectively solve the existing problems. The stochastic gradient descent is applied to the SVD algorithm to accelerate the convergence speed of the model, improve the performance of the model, and effectively improve the accuracy of score prediction.  © 2022 Luxi Zhang and Yongli Gao.","","Behavioral research;

These days, visitors can access reliable CH content using Web and mobile-based interfaces. However, conventional CH systems still lack the ability to provide meaningful semantically overt results that precisely meet user information needs in this domain. In addition, they often ignore the user search context and experience, which hinders their ability to adapt their behavior to the preferences, tasks, interests, and other user functionalities. In this article, we aim to address the issue of designing a precision-oriented multilingual and multi-criteria semantic-based mobile recommender system specifically targeting Palestine's CH, a country with great historical and cultural importance. We aim to better facilitate users' access to CH content by providing them with multiple search functionalities. In this context, a user can search for relevant information using keywords (a.k.a. tags) or sentence-like queries and the system retrieves all relevant documents based on their semantic similarity. A second option is to search using current location information to retrieve correlated historical places and events. Finally, starting from a picture of interest, a third option makes it possible to extract captions describing its content that can be used to search for additional contextually relevant information. Additionally, the proposed system aims at personalizing users' experience through progressively delivering output that meets their information needs based on a number of parameters such as users' logging data, interests, previous searches, and location-based information. A prototype of the proposed system has been developed and tested using Android smartphones and a manually constructed ontology enriched with CH links to the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) and DBpedia. By comparing our system with similar systems in this domain, findings demonstrate that it provides additional search features and functionalities to users. The proposed Holy-Land ontology is the first of its kind attempting to encode knowledge about Palestine's CH. It plays a crucial role in our proposal, serving as a pivotal entity in the combination of language-based, location-based, and visual-based retrieval strategies.  © 2021 ACM.","content-based image retrieval; Cultural heritage; hybrid recommendation; knowledge-based search; manually constructed ontology; semantic similarity","Location; Ontology; Semantic Web; Semantics; Service industry; Smartphones; User experience; Visual languages; Cultural heritages; Location information; Location-based information; Mobile recommender systems; Retrieval strategies; Semantic similarity; User information need; Users' experiences; Search engines","","","","","","","Zerbini A., Developing a heritage database for the Middle East and North Africa, J.

Social media platforms are the most common internet applications due to the large number of users. The numerous posts, likes, etc. have accrued on social media platforms and can be used in variety of recommendation systems. In this work, the primary focus is the tourism domain, where RS serves as a valuable tool for the tourist to plan his trip. Traditional RS systems only cater to the needs of the tourist by examining few factors. However, there are a large range of factors such as environment factors , actual geo-coordinates, trip destination, preferences of the user etc. that need to be taken into account in order to make a foolproof recommendation to the tourists. Tourism Recommendation Systems (TRS) provide suggestions to the tourists to identify the most suited transport (flight, train, etc.), accommodations, museums, special interest places and other items which are required for the trip. Several techniques are used and a thorough study of various techniques of traditional RS and TRS techniques have been done which are specially designed for tourism domain. Various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been highlighted which are used to solve the tourist recommendation problem. Also, future research direction has been suggested which would improvise the Quality of Service (QoS) of the RS in tourism industry. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","AI; Itineraries; POIs; RS; Social media; Tour recommendation; Tourism","Quality of service; Tourism; Computer-based system; Environment factors; Future research directions; Internet application; Itinerary; POI; Social media; Social media platforms; Survey research; Tour recommendation; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Al-Shamri M.Y.H., Bharadwaj K.K., Fuzzy-genetic approach to recommender systems based on a novel hybrid user model, Expert Syst Appl, 35, pp. 1386-1399, (2008); Aliannejadi M., Crestani F., Personalized context-aware point of interest recommendation, ACM Trans Inf Syst, 36, pp. 1-45, (2018); Alonso K., Zorrilla M., Inan H., Palau M., Confalonieri R., Vazquez-Salceda J., Calle J., Castro E., Ontology-based tourism for all recommender and information retrieval system for interactive community displays, 2012 8Th International Conference on Information Science and Digital Content Technology (ICIDT2012), 3, pp. 650-655, (2012); Amatriain X., Jaimes A., Oliver N., Pujol J., Data mining methods for recommender systems, Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 39-71, (2011); Ashbrook D., Starner T., Using gps to learn significant locations and predict movement across multiple users, Pers Ubiquit Comput, 7, pp. 275-286, (2003); Ayala V.A.A., Gulsen K.C., Alzogbi A., Farber M., Muniz M., Lausen G., A Delay-Robust Touristic Plan Recommendation Using Real-World Public Transportation Information, (2017); Banerjee S., Chis M., Dangayach G., Developing an adaptive learning based tourism information system using ant colony metaphor, Studies Comput Intell, 273, pp. 59-77, (2010); Batet M., Moreno A., Sanchez D., Isern D., Valls A., Turist@: agent-based personalised recommendation of touristic activities, Expert Syst Appl, 39, pp. 7319-7329, (2012); Bedi P., Agarwal S.K., Jindal V., Richa Marst: multi-agent recommender system for e-tourism using reputation based collaborative filtering, Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Databases in Networked Information Systems - Volume 8381 DNIS 2014, pp. 189-201, (2014); Billsus D., Pazzani M., User modeling for adaptive news access, User Model User-Adap Inter, 10, pp. 147-180, (2000); Bin C., Tianlong G., Sun Y., Chang L., A personalized poi route recommendation system based on heterogeneous tourism data and sequential pattern mining, Multimed Tool Appl, 78, (2019); Borras J., Moreno A., Valls A., Intelligent tourism recommender systems: a survey, Expert Syst Appl, 41, pp. 7370-7389, (2014); Borras J., Valls A., Moreno A., Isern D., Ontology-based management of uncertain preferences in user profiles, Advances in Computational Intelligence, pp. 127-136, (2012); Brilhante I., Macedo J.A., Nardini F.M., Perego R., Renso C., Where shall we go today?: Planning touristic tours with tripbuilder, In: Proceedings of the 22Nd ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management, pp. 757-762, (2013); Brilhante I.R., Macedo J.A., Nardini F.M., Perego R., Renso C., On planning sightseeing tours with tripbuilder, Inform Process Manag, 51, pp. 1-15, (2015); Brudy F., Ledo D., Greenberg S., Butz A., Is anyone looking?

Using computer graphics' visual representations to convey the message to average people has certainly helped a lot to popularize the weather forecast consumption by the general public. However, these representations are not information rich since they are abstractions; moreover they are not very actionable on the receiver side to help one decide how s/he will ""live""the forecast weather conditions and prepare appropriately. Therefore, there is a need to personalize the forecast based on past experience of the individuals and their personal needs. The forecast has to become more human- and needs-oriented and more focused to the particular requirements of each individual person. We, thus, propose a new co-creation process in which the audience is called to provide a daily feedback on how they lived the weather conditions personally on a daily basis, so that, ""my personal forecast""can be produced making the forecast more actionable on the user side. Preliminary such attempts focused solely on the ""feels like""temperature forecasts. To arrive at the ""my personal forecast"", artificial intelligence based recommender systems need to be applied, using fuzzy logic as the appropriate method for the user to express the individually perceived weather conditions.  © Copyright: ","","","","","","","","","Agboola A.

Thanks to the efforts in the fields of Semantic Web and Linked Open Data a growing number of interlinked knowledge bases are supporting the development of advanced knowledge-based applications. Unfortunately, for a large number of domain-specific applications, these knowledge bases are unavailable. In this paper, we present a resource consisting of a large knowledge graph linking the Italian cultural heritage entities (defined in the ArCo ontology) with the concepts defined on well-known knowledge bases (i.e., DBpedia and the Getty GVP ontology). We describe the methodologies adopted for the semi-automatic resource creation and provide an in-depth analysis of the resulting interlinked graph. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.","ArCo; Cultural Heritage; DBpedia; GVP; Knowledge Graph; Linked Open Data; Ontology","Knowledge graph; Linked data; Open Data; Cultural heritages; Dbpedia; GVP; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge-based applications; Linked open datum; Natural language understanding; Ontology's; Search recommenders; Semantic-Web; Ontology","","","","","DBpedia; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR","Funding text 1: This work was carried out within the research project “SMARTOUR: intelligent platform for tourism” funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research with the Regional Development Fund of European Union (PON Research and Competitiveness 2007-2013).; Funding text 2: Numerous efforts have been made in recent years to create knowledge bases (Abu-Salih, 2021). Humans and machines require a formal definition of knowledge to enhance a variety of activities in support of applications such as automated reasoning, cataloging, documentation, discovery, promotion, and recommendation of large collections of entities and facts. Specifically, all the applications involving Machine Learning, or in general, Artificial Intelligence algorithms, perform better under the presence of large collections of data (Feigenbaum, 1984). Unfortunately, the creation of formal representations of knowledge is both a complex task, requiring the participation of experts, and a time-consuming process. To address this problem, the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data (LOD) communities have provided mechanisms for the definition of formal ontologies and the interconnection of entities through knowledge bases (Gandon, 2018), thus helping both humans and machines during the creation and engineering of knowledge bases. LOD data have been created in many domains, but in many others, they are still largely unavailable. For example, despite the great interest in cultural heritage data (Mountantonakis and Tzitzikas, 2019), interlinking efforts are limited to relatively small resources, such as entities from libraries, archeological sites and museums (Pontes et al., 2020; Kyriaki-Manessi et al., 2018). In this paper, we describe the adopted methodologies and the resulting edition of a very large resource obtained within the ArCo, GVP and DBpedia Linking Initiative (AGDLI) (Faralli et al., 2021). AGDLI is a research activity within the project SMARTOUR: intelligent platforms for tourism, funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research, aimed at linking the ArCo’s catalogue of Italian cultural entities (Car-riero et al., 2019) to the well-known Getty Vocabulary Program (GVP) (Harpring, 2010) and DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) ontologies, with the main goal of providing a semantically rich and structured representation of the Italian cultural heritage for knowledge-based applications. The main objective of our linking initiative is putting together the qualities of two large resources, one of which, ArCO, provides rich, but mostly unstructured, descriptions of Italian cultural heritage entities, while the other, GVP, is a highly structured lexical taxonomy of cultural heritage concepts. Our resource is aimed at supporting and enhancing various activities, such as, for example, cataloging activities in museums, or suggesting personalized tours based on the artistic and historical interests of users (Binucci et al., 2017). Furthermore, the resource provides the basis for an on-going graph completion task, since, given the semi-automatic nature of the adopted linking methodologies and the incompleteness of the linked resources, the resulting knowledge graph is expected to be both error-prone and incomplete. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we describe the resources we are interlinking; in Section 3, we provide details about the investigated semi-supervised methodologies involved for our linking purposes; in Section 4, we provide an in-depth analysis of the resulting resource; in Section 5 we briefly describe the related work; and finally, in Section 6, we discuss future research directions and plans.","Abu-Salih B., Domain-specific knowledge graphs: A survey, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 185, (2021); Ali M., Berrendorf M., Hoyt C.

Their goal is to adapt the output to the characteristics (i.e., interests and preferences) of the active user. To achieve this purpose, a process of inferring these characteristics is needed. In this paper, we verify the existence of some significant correlation between the facial micro-expressions of individuals and their emotional state. If so, we could think of monitoring the user while enjoying a certain visual stimulus, to understand her emotional response. For example, we could comprehend whether a visitor of a museum or an exhibition likes or dislikes the object she is observing, thus deriving her interests and tastes, regardless of the reality from which she comes. It could foster the role of the museum/exhibition intended as a vehicle of aggregation between a broad range of users, thus favoring their cultural and social inclusion. It could also allow us to design and realize recommender systems for enhancing the experience of users with difficulty in explicitly expressing their interests, such as people belonging to vulnerable groups (e.g., elderly, children, disabled people) or different cultures. Although the sample analyzed is limited and concerns a specific context (i.e., music video clips), the experimental results have been encouraging, thus spurring us to carry on with our research activities. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors","Computer vision; Deep Learning; Museum visitors; User interfaces","Computer vision; Deep learning; Exhibitions; Interface states; Museums; Deep learning; Disabled people; Emotional response; Emotional state; Micro-expressions; Museum visitor; Music video; Social inclusion; Visual stimulus; Vulnerable groups; User interfaces","","","","","","","Gordon M., Solitude and privacy: How technology is destroying our aloneness and why it matters, Technology in Society, 68, (2022); D'Aniello G., Gaeta M., Orciuoli F., Sansonetti G., Sorgente F., Knowledge-based smart city service system, Electronics (Switzerland), 9, pp. 1-22, (2020); Vaccaro L., Sansonetti G., Micarelli A., An empirical review of automated machine learning, Computers, 10, (2021); Sansonetti G., Gasparetti F., D'Aniello G., Micarelli A., Unreliable users detection in social media: Deep learning techniques for automatic detection, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 213154-213167, (2020); Hassan H.

In the context of Internet technology, the use of digital multimedia for personalized recommendation is an effective way to promote the transmission of intangible cultural heritage. However, traditional recommendation systems tend to treat different members as homogeneous objects, ignoring the relationship between members' professional backgrounds and the inherent properties of items, and cannot truly solve the problem of conflicting preferences in the integration process. In view of this, this paper proposes a group recommendation system based on nonnegative matrix decomposition. First, the group rating information is decomposed into a user matrix and item matrix by nonnegative matrix decomposition. Then, the item affiliation matrix and member expertise matrix are calculated by using the affiliation and expertise weights for the two matrices, respectively, and the contribution degree of each member to different item ratings is obtained from them. Finally, the group preference model is constructed by weighted fusion of members' preferences based on their contribution degrees, and different recommendation lists are generated for different user preferences. The experimental results prove that this system has high recommendation accuracy in cross-regional promotion of PICH.  © 2022 Qin Wang.","","Matrix algebra; Contribution degree; Digital multimedia; Globalisation; Intangible cultural heritages; Internet technology; matrix; Nonnegative matrix decompositions; Personalized recommendation; Personalized recommendation systems; Regional promotions; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Xu B.C., Pan J.H., Analysis of structural characteristics and spatial distribution of the national intangible cultural heritage in China and its policy implications, Sciences in Cold and Arid Regions, 11, 5, pp. 389-406, (2019); Liu X., International communication of intangible cultural heritage in central plains: A case study of Chinese Wushu, International Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities, 2, 3, pp. 196-204, (2018); He X., Tang J., Du X., Hong R., Ren T., Chua T.S., Fast matrix factorization with nonuniform weights on missing data, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 31, 8, pp. 2791-2804, (2020); Dahdouh K., Dakkak A., Oughdir L., Ibriz A., Large-scale e-learning recommender system based on Spark and Hadoop, Journal of Big Data, 6, 1, pp. 1-23, (2019); El Handri K., Idrissi A., Parallelization of topk algorithm through a new hybrid recommendation system for big data in spark cloud computing framework, IEEE Systems Journal, 15, 4, pp. 4876-4886, (2021); Wu S., Research on the application of spatial partial differential equation in user oriented information mining, Alexandria Engineering Journal, 59, 4, pp. 2193-2199, (2020); Zhou L., Product advertising recommendation in e-commerce based on deep learning and distributed expression, Electronic Commerce Research, 20, 2, pp. 321-342, (2020); Huang Z., Shan G., Cheng J., Sun J., TRec: An efficient recommendation system for hunting passengers with deep neural networks, Neural Computing and Applications, 31, S1, pp. 209-222, (2019); Batmaz Z., Yurekli A., Bilge A., Kaleli C., A review on deep learning for recommender systems: Challenges and remedies, Artificial Intelligence Review, 52, 1, pp. 1-37, (2019); Dara S., Chowdary C.R., Kumar C., A survey on group recommender systems, Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 54, 2, pp. 271-295, (2020); Schedl M., Zamani H., Chen C.W., Deldjoo Y., Elahi M., Current challenges and visions in music recommender systems research, International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval, 7, 2, pp. 95-116, (2018); Jiang L., Cheng Y., Yang L., Li J., Yan H., Wang X., A trust-based collaborative filtering algorithm for E-commerce recommendation system, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 10, 8, pp. 3023-3034, (2019); Camacho L.A.G., Alves-Souza S.N., Social network data to alleviate cold-start in recommender system: A systematic review, Information Processing & Management, 54, 4, pp. 529-544, (2018); Khelloufi A., Ning H., Dhelim S., Qiu T., Ma J., Huang R., Atzori L., A social-relationships-based service recommendation system for SIoT devices, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8, 3, pp. 1859-1870, (2021); Deldjoo Y., Schedl M., Cremonesi P., Pasi G., Recommender systems leveraging multimedia content, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 53, 5, pp. 1-38, (2020); Yi B., Shen X., Liu H., Zhang Z., Zhang W., Liu S., Xiong N., Deep matrix factorization with implicit feedback embedding for recommendation system, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 15, 8, pp. 4591-4601, (2019); Luo X., Zhou M., Li S., Wu D., Liu Z., Shang M., Algorithms of unconstrained non-negative latent factor analysis for recommender systems, IEEE Transactions on Big Data, 7, 1, pp. 227-240, (2021); Jiang S., Li K., Da Xu R.Y., Relative pairwise relationship constrained non-negative matrix factorisation, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 31, 8, pp. 1595-1609, (2019); Asma S., Mustansar A.G., Misbah I., Building accurate and practical recommender system algorithms using machine learning classifier and collaborative filtering, Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering, 42, 8, pp. 3229-3247, (2017); Li J.J., Zhang K., Yang X.L., Wei P., Wang J., Mitra K., Ranjan R., Category preferred canopy k-means based collaborative filtering algorithm, Future Generation Computer Systems, 93, pp. 1046-1054, (2019); Sharma B., Hashmi A., Gupta C., Khalaf O.I., Abdulsahib G.M., Itani M.M., Hybrid sparrow clustered (HSC) algorithm for top-N recommendation system, Symmetry, 14, 4, (2022); Yi H., Niu Z., Zhang F., Li X., Wang Y., Robust recommendation algorithm based on kernel principal component analysis and fuzzy C-means clustering, Wuhan University Journal of Natural Sciences, 23, 2, pp. 111-119, (2018)","China","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","16875680","","","","English","Adv.

Many digital humanities projects tend to model their data based on CIDOC-CRM ontology, which offers a wide array of classes appropriate for storing humanities and cultural heritage data. The CIDOC-CRM ontology model leads to a knowledge graph structure in which many entities are often linked to each other through chains of relations, which means that relevant information often lies many hops away from their entities. In this paper, we present a method based on graph walks and text processing to extract entity information and provide semantically relevant embeddings. In the process, we were able to generate similarity recommenda-tions as well as explore their underlying data structure. This approach was then demonstrated on the Sphaera Dataset which was modeled according to the CIDOC-CRM data structure. © 2021 by the authors.

A mobile recommendation system (MRS) that classifies in situ visitors according to different visiting profiles could act as a mediator between their visiting preferences and cultural content. Drawing on the above, in this paper, we propose ACUX Recommender (ACUX-R), an MRS, for recommending personalized cultural POIs to visitors based on their visiting preferences. ACUX-R experimentally employs the ACUX typology for assigning profiles to cultural visitors. ACUX-R was evaluated through a user study and a questionnaire. The evaluation conducted showed that the proposed ACUX-R satisfies cultural visitors and is capable of capturing their nonverbal visiting preferences and needs. © 2022 by the authors.","cultural destinations; cultural heritage; mobile tourist guide; personalization; personalized suggestions; profile classification; user interface","User profile; Cultural destination; Cultural heritages; Mobile applications; Mobile recommendations; Mobile tourist guide; Personalizations; Personalized service; Personalized suggestion; Profile classification; Scientific fields; Recommender systems","","","","","European Union and Greek national funds; Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation; RESEARCH CREATE INNOVATE, (MIS—5056234)","This research was co-financed by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH CREATE INNOVATE (project name: CAnTi, project code: MIS—5056234).","Alexandridis G., Chrysanthi A., Tsekouras G.E., Caridakis G., Personalized and Content Adaptive Cultural Heritage Path Recommendation: An Application to the Gournia and Çatalhöyük Archaeological Sites, User Model.

This mechanism matches a user with listeners that have similar tastes, and uses their listening history to find songs that the user will probably like. The fundamental issue with this approach is that artists already need to have a significant user following to get a fair chance of being recommended. This is known as the music cold-start problem. In this work, we investigate the possibility of making music recommendations based on audio content so that new artists still get a good chance of being recommended, even if they do not have a sufficient number of listeners yet. We propose the use of Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) to determine the similarity between two audio clips. Each clip is first pre-processed into a Mel-Spectrogram, which is then used as input to an SNN consisting of two identical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The output of each CNN is then compared together to determine whether two songs are similar or not. These were trained using audio from the Free Music Archive, with the genre used as a heuristic to determine the similarity between song pairs. A query-by-multiple-example (QBME) music recommendation system was developed that makes use of the proposed content-based similarity metric to find songs that match the user's tastes. This was packaged inside an online blind-test survey, which first prompts participants to select a set of preferred songs, and then recommends a number of songs which the subject is expected to listen to and rate on a Likert scale. The recommendations from the proposed algorithm were stochastically interleaved with songs selected randomly from the preferred genres of the user, as a baseline for comparison. The participants were not aware that the recommendations came from two different algorithms. Our findings show that 60.7% of the 150 participants gave higher ratings to the recommendations made by the proposed SNN-based algorithm. Findings also show that 55% of the recommended songs had less than 1,500 listens, demonstrating that the proposed content-based approach can provide a fairer exposure to all artists based on their music, independent of their fame and popularity.  © 2021 Owner/Author.","Deep Metric Learning; Music Recommendation; Siamese Networks","Audio acoustics; Collaborative filtering; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Recommender systems; Surveys; Cold-start; Content-based; Convolutional neural network; Deep metric learning; Listening history; Metric learning; Music recommendation; Music Recommendation System; Neural-networks; Siamese network; Music","","","","","","","Adebiyi S., An Emotion Based Music Recommender System Using Deep Learning, (2020); Bogdanov D., Berois M.H., Fuhrmann F., Gomez Gutierrez E., Boyer H., Et al., Content-based music recommendation based on user preference examples, Proceedings of the Workshop on Music Recommendation and Discovery 2010 (WOMRAD 2010), pp. 33-38, (2010); Bromley J., Bentz J.W., Bottou L., Guyon I., LeCun Y., Moore C., Sackinger E., Shah R., Signature verifcation using a ""siamese"" time delay neural network, International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artifcial Intelligence, 7, 4, pp. 669-688, (1993); Burns J., Van Zyl T.L., Automated music recommendations using similarity learning, First Southern African Conference for Artifcial Intelligence Research.

The preservation of cultural heritage, the development of video recommendation systems, the support of learners via tutoring systems will benefit from the capture and evaluation of dance-related multimedia content. Because of its detailed hand gesture, Indian classical dance (ICD) classification is still an enthralling field of study. This provides a framework for analyzing various computer vision and deep learning ideas. Automated teaching solutions across all disciplines, from traditional to online forums, become unavoidable through changes in learning habits. ICD also becomes a crucial component of a thriving culture and heritage that must be updated and preserved at all costs. The dance involves complex positions like self-hands-occlusion and full-body rotation. The main objective of this study is, in the Bharatanatyam dancing style we proposed a framework for categorizing hasta mudras. Our Convolution Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) deep knowledge architecture for Indian Classical Dancing (ICD) categorization now includes a new hand posture signature. By guessing where people's hands would be, we rated dance performances. This architecture assesses hand poses using information and information pruning, while a dance instructor application assesses the time and accuracy of student dances. 252 YouTube videos of the Bharatanatyam dance form has been used to make up the dataset used in our research.This study offers a methodology with three-phase deep learning techniques. Then, using the pre-Trained paradigm TensorFlow EfficientNet UNet, which aids us in determining any hand position within the frame, we extracted the appropriate joint locations of the hands from each video frame. Then, cosine similarity was used to identify or correlate the indicated action factors. Finally, using key details from the hand pose, we categorized it and trained the Convolution Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) network structure using the classification system's training dataset. Regarding factors like accuracy, F1-score, AUC curve, recall and precision, the proposed CNN-LSTM structure for classifying hand mudras is compared with Convolutional LSTM Long Term Recurrent Convolutional Network(LRCN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), LSTM and 3D Convolutional Layer (CONV3D). As a result, it was found that throughout the examination process, the proposed CNN-LSTM classification structure achieved 98.53% accuracy, 99.04% precision, 98.49% recall, 99.12% AUC score, and 98.74% F1-score. This achieves 94.03% accuracy, 93.13% precision, 94.76% recall, 96.06% AUC score, and 93.53% F1-score during the training method. © 2023 Lavoisier.

This paper aims to explore the current state of research into serendipity particularly related to information encountering. Design/methodology/approach: This study provides bibliometric review of 166 studies on serendipity extracted from the Web of Science. Two bibliometric analysis tools HisCite and RStudio (Biblioshiny) are used on 30 years of data. Citation counts and bibliographic records of the papers are assessed using HisCite. Moreover, visualization of prominent sources, countries, keywords and the collaborative networks of authors and institutions are assessed using RStudio (Biblioshiny) software. A total of 166 papers on serendipity were found from the period 1989 to 2022, and the most influential authors, articles, journals, institutions and countries among these were determined. Findings: The highest numbers of 11 papers were published in the year 2019. Makri and Erdelez are the most influential authors for contributing studies on serendipity. “Journal of Documentation” is the top-ranking journal. University College London is the prominent affiliation contributing highest number of studies on serendipity. The UK and the USA are the prominent nations contributing highest number of research. Authorship pattern for research on serendipity reveals involvement of single author in majority of the studies. OA Green model is the most preferred model for archiving of research articles by the authors who worked on serendipity.

Artificial intelligence, one of the most cutting-edge technologies, is presently utilized in a number of different businesses. The combination of these factors led to the development of ""Intelligent Tourism,""which may be considered as the evolution of modern tourism. Intelligent systems are conscious of their surroundings and gain knowledge from the activities they take to accomplish particular objectives. They are more frequently utilized to support decision-making, work processes, and information gathering for tourism. Intelligent information systems should be effective enough to deliver accurate, accurate, and timely information to the appropriate person in order to achieve the goals of intelligent tourism. It's crucial to give tourists the information they need in order to understand how intelligent tourism behaves. The past ten years have seen a significant amount of study activity in the area of next-generation intelligent tourism, but our findings show that none of the research studies conducted in the past included a thorough literature assessment in this sector. The methodologies and core ideas that are most frequently applied in the field of intelligent tourism are identified in this article, and they are presented in depth together with the relevant papers. We succeeded in achieving this by critically assessing a significant number of latest research papers. This study identifies the following ideas as crucial ones: intelligent information system, big data, enhanced reality, social media, real-time information sharing, context awareness, cultural heritage, recommender systems, and user modelling. Important topics related to sustainable intelligent tourism are examined concurrently in order to lay the groundwork for future studies on the tourism arena. © 2023 IEEE.","AI; Intelligent information system; recommender system; smart tourism; social tourism; sustainable tourism","Decision making; Information systems; Information use; Intelligent systems; Real time systems; Tourism; Cutting edge technology; Decisions makings; Global scale; Intelligent information systems; Smart tourism; Social tourism; Sustainable tourism; Technological advancement; Tourism industry; Work process; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Tuo Y., Et al., How artificial intelligence will change the future of tourism industry: The practice in China, Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2021, pp. 83-94, (2021); Rai Goyal H., Sharma S., Flood Management System Using Cloud Computing and Internet-of-Things, 5th International Conference on Nascent Technologies in Engineering (ICNTE 2023).

The driving factor of this framework was the fact that the presence of security cameras has become universal, including at sites of cultural heritage. ARTYCUL used the video streams of closed-circuit televisions (CCTV) cameras installed in such premises to detect human figures, and their coordinates with respect to the camera frames were used to visualize the density of visitors around the specific display items. Such a framework that can display the popularity of artifacts would aid the curators towards a more optimal organization. Moreover, it could also help to gauge if a certain display item were neglected due to incorrect placement. While items of similar interest can be placed in vicinity of each other, an online recommendation system may also use the reputation of an artifact to catch the eye of the visitors. Artificial intelligence-based solutions are well suited for analysis of internet of things (IoT) traffic due to the inherent veracity and volatile nature of the transmissions. The work done for the development of ARTYCUL provided a deeper insight into the avenues for applications of IoT technology to the cultural heritage domain, and suitability of ML to process real-time data at a fast pace. While we also observed common issues that hinder the utilization of IoT in the cultural domain, the proposed framework was designed keeping in mind the same obstacles and a preference for backward compatibility. © 2021 by the authors.

Most existing methods adopt music content (i.e., the audio signal) to alleviate this problem. But these approaches typically overlook the emotional characteristics embedded in the music, which is particularly important for modeling the characteristics of the songs. Considering the existence of negative and positive classifications of songs and the existence of alternating processes of calmness and excitement in song melodies. We propose an emotion-aware music recommender method (EAMR) via Mel spectrogram and the arousal-valence model. First, each audio clip is transformed into a log-Mel spectrogram, and a deep neural network extracts the emotional features. Meanwhile, each audio clip is dimensionally reduced to a 16-dimensional feature vector normalized to obtain each sentiment feature vector of songs. Second, the Euclidean distance of the song feature vector is calculated to recommend the song with the highest similarity to the user's current favorite. Finally, taking into account the impact of features extracted by different convolutional kernels on the model, the ability of model feature extraction is further improved by introducing an attention mechanism called Att-EAMR. The proposed methods are tested on the public Spotify Million Playlist dataset and the free music archive dataset FMA. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the other comparison approaches when the system faces a cold start. © 2022 IEEE.","arousal-valence model; deep neural network; mel spectrogram; music recommender; sentiment feature","Audio acoustics; Audio recordings; Music; Recommender systems; Spectrographs; Arousal-valence model; Audio clips; Audio signal; Cold-start; Features vector; Mel spectrogram; Music contents; Music recommende; Sentiment features; Spectrograms; Deep neural networks","","","","","Wuhan Sports University, (2022S10)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the Wuhan Sports University Young Teachers' Research Fund Project Grant (No. 2022S10).","Liu R., Hu X., A Multimodal Music Recommendation System with Listeners' Personality and Physiological Signals, pp. 357-360, (2020); Schedl M., Zamani H., Chen C.-W., Deldjoo Y., Elahi M., Current challenges and visions in music recommender systems research, Int.

An immersive user experience can be developed that is innovative, dynamic, and customised for each attendee. Museums have already begun to move towards interactive exhibitions utilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IOT), and more recently, the use of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) has become more common in cultural heritage spaces to present items of historical significance. VR concentrates on the provision of full immersion within a digitised environment utilising a headset, whilst AR focuses on the inclusion of digitised content within the existing physical environment that can be accessed through a medium such as a mobile phone application. Machine learning techniques such as a recommender system can support an immersive user journey by issuing personalised recommendations regarding a user’s preferred future content based on their previous activity. An ethical approach is necessary to take the precautions required to protect the welfare of human participants and eliminate any aspect of stereotyping or biased behaviour. This paper sets out a human-centred manifesto intended to provide guidance when inducing smart digital immersion in cultural heritage spaces. A review of existing digital cultural heritage projects was conducted to determine their adherence to the manifesto with the findings indicating that Education was a primary focus across all projects and that Personalisation, Respect and Empathy, and Support were also highly valued. Additionally, the findings indicated that there were areas with room for improvement such as Fairness to ensure that a well-balanced human-centred system is implemented. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Cultural heritage; Digital; Human-centred; Immersive; Manifesto; User journey","Artificial intelligence; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Learning systems; Virtual reality; 'current; Case-studies; Cultural heritages; Digital; Digital technologies; Human centered systems; Human-centered; Immersive; Manifesto; User journey; Augmented reality","","","","","Horizon 2020","When the manifesto was finalised, a desk review was conducted of existing projects in the cultural heritage space which focused on the user experience and the use of digital technologies to the benefit the attendee.

Film recommendation systems enable users to sort and select the best film fans to see without going through thousands of films which were stored in archives. A total of 392 samples were collected from movie datasets available in kaggle. For this two algorithms were used, one Matrix Decomposition algorithm and another Support Vector Regression(SVR) algorithm, both the algorithms were executed and compared for accuracy. SVR achieved accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity of 87%, 88%, 89% and 93% respectively compared to 80%, 83%, 84% and 86% by the Matrix Decomposition algorithm. The results were obtained with a level of significance with (p<0.05) pretest power of 80%.

We suggest examining the use of recommender systems for social recommendations (defined here) to enact social change. We suggest the use of this technology for encouraging visitors to cultural heritage sites to explore diversity of opinions and perspectives related to artifacts and events and to reflect - implementing an interpretation-reflection loop. Visitors are encouraged not only to explore diversity of content but to contribute their own perspective, so others can explore it in the future.

However, it is unclear which recommendation is suitable for indoor museum guidance. This study evaluated a recommender system based on social-filtering and statistical methods applied to actual museum databases. We evaluated both methods using two different datasets. Statistical methods use collective data, whereas social methods use individual data. The results showed that both methods could provide significantly better results than random methods. However, we found that the trip time length and the dataset’s sizes affect the performance of both methods. The social-filtering method provides better performance for long trip periods and includes more complex calculations, whereas the statistical method provides better performance for short trip periods. The critical points are defined to indicate the trip time for which the performances of both methods are equal. © The Korea Institute of Information and Communication Engineering","Evaluation; Museum; Recommendation; Similarity; Statistic","","","","","","Chao Sam Phraya Museum and Schwadogon Museum; University of Computer Study Yangon","We would like to thank Chao Sam Phraya Museum and Schwadogon Museum, essential resources for this study.

Additionally, the paper aims to evaluate the potential of such methods and activities in supporting the analysis and reflection processes within the SPICE Interpretation-Reflection loop (IRL). We explore a selection of narrative-based methods for citizen curation to propose an approach for eliciting meaningful stories related to cultural heritage artifacts from citizens. The proposed approach is subsequently applied in a digital co-design workshop, conducted with members of the SPICE consortium, including the five SPICE museum partners. The collected story contributions are thereafter analysed using qualitative methods and tools adapted from narrative inquiry and the study of narrative identity. The findings provide valuable insights into the potential of narrative-based approaches for citizen engagement in the cultural heritage domain and support the development of the SPICE digital tools for promoting reflection, i.e. sentiment analysis, personalization, recommendation systems, and user- and community modeling tools. In SPICE, such tools play a central role in enabling citizens to create representations of themselves, while also cultivating an understanding and appreciation of similarities and differences across citizen groups. In this direction, the paper offers ideas and insights for designing engaging participatory approaches to elicit citizen input. At the same time, it aims to support the development of digital systems and tools in the cultural heritage domain, with the goal of fostering more inclusive and dynamic representations of citizens and citizen groups.  © 2023 ACM.","citizen curation; co-design; cultural heritage; interpretation; narrative analysis; narrative identity; narrative inquiry; narrative methods; personalization; reflection; SPICE; story elicitation","Sentiment analysis; 'spice'; Citizen curation; Co-designs; Cultural heritages; Curation; Interpretation; Narrative analysis; Narrative identity; Narrative inquiries; Narrative method; Personalizations; Story elicitation; Digital devices","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (SPICE 870811)","The research leading to these results/this publication has been partially funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601 under grant agreement SPICE 870811.

At the same time, it also prompted more scholars' thinking beyond embracing the technological changes in the field information resource management. Based on this, we invited 6 experts to carry out related discussions from the perspective of the disciplinary construction and development of information resource management. (1) AIGC and the field of library and information service: The essence of the rapid development of AI technology lies in the improvement of people's ability in knowledge acquisition brought by the continuous enrichment of data resources and the improvement of quality. The professionals in the field of library and information service should fully understand their value and their role, give full play to the advantages of data resources in libraries, effectively utilize their expertise in knowledge organization and management, actively promote research and development of AI technology, and contribute their wisdom and solutions. (2) The disruptive change brought about by AIGC: The emergence of ChatGPT has brought subversive challenges to the library and information service field. The professionals in this field should actively promote the transformation of the AI era, seize the opportunity, and explore new growth points around knowledge production, resource discovery, knowledge relevance and scientific research ethics. In addition, they should give play to the advantages of our country's political system and intensive development policies, promote the transformation of information services to knowledge content generation service, and raise the knowledge productivity of the whole society. (3) AIGC and cultural heritage resources: ChatGPT has ushered in an era of model-driven content production and carry out innovation in the mode of intelligent service of cultural heritage resources supported by AIGC. In addition, this paper also analyzes the copyright ownership, real-time, interpretability, verifiability, trustworthiness, algorithm bias and cognitive misdirection of large-scale AIGCs. In the future, universal value rationality such as public order and good customs should be endowed with the AIGC, and the paradigm change in the field of cultural heritage should be actively welcomed and promoted. (4) AIGC and researches on intelligent information processing of ancient books: While ChatGPT plays a positive role in promoting intelligent information processing of ancient books and promoting cultural transmission and civilization inheritance, it also brings challenges in cultural value and national security, content security and information governance, information literacy and humanistic education. It is necessary to make efforts in the aspects like providing higher quality and larger scale of precise processing of ancient books in the future, so as to build a scientific, comprehensive and systematic system of information security and digital ethics. (5) AIGC and intelligent tool revolution: This paper analyzes the three elements of big data, giant model and huge computing power in the development of AIGC technology, as well as the four development directions of large and complete data volume, fine granularity of data analysis, multi-source and multi-mode semantic integration of semantic association, human-computer integration of information services and intelligent interaction. It is pointed out that AIGC will bring about the paradigm change of content production in three aspects: production innovation, automatic generation and ecological cultivation. At the same time, it will also bring challenges in technology monopoly and hegemony, network information security technology integration and other aspects. (6) AIGC and library: Based on the analysis of the core technology innovation trend in the ChatGPT model expansion, data enhancement and model fusion, this paper demonstrates the necessity and crisis of using ChatGPT in libraries. In addition, from five aspects of intelligent management system, retrieval system, recommendation system, question answering system and search engine, this paper puts forward some suggestions on the use of GPT in library service integration and innovation promotion. © 2023 Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

Quality-diversity algorithms are commonly used for this purpose, as they can provide diverse suggestions that represent salient areas of the solution space, showcasing designs with high fitness and wide variety. Because generated suggestions drive the search process, it is important that they provide inspiration, but also stay aligned with the designer&#x0027;s intentions. Additionally, often many interactions with the system are required before the designer is content with a solution. In this work, we tackle these challenges with an interactive constrained MAP-Elites system that leverages emitters to learn the preferences of the designer and then use them in automated steps. By learning preferences, the generated designs remain aligned with the designer&#x0027;s intent, and by applying automatic steps, we generate more solutions per user interaction, giving a larger number of choices to the designer and thereby speeding up the search. We propose a general framework for preference-learning emitters (PLEs) and apply it to a procedural content generation task in the video game Space Engineers. We built an interactive application for our algorithm and performed a user study with players.

By combining transactional data and archival customer records, a unique database was compiled from which proxy variables were extracted to represent dimensions of consumer loyalty and shopping involvement. These variables were combined in regression analysis with technical characteristics of two types of algorithms employed for generating recommendations: the EMDE algorithm, relying on the LSH method, and the industry-standard CF-RS. Statistical analysis reveals that recommendations are more successful when visual data modality is combined with behavioural data. Better recommendation performance was found to be associated with lower levels of consumer involvement in shopping, as well as higher levels of trust and engagement with the vendor. Experience with the vendor showed a negative correlation with recommendation performance through both its main effect and by its interactions with other consumer-related variables. © 2022, The Author(s).","Consumer loyalty; Data modalities; Fashion industry; Online recommendation system performance; Shopping involvement","","","","","","","","Ajzen I., The theory of planned behaviour: Frequently asked questions, Human Behaviour and Emerging Technologies, 2, 4, pp. 314-324, (2020); Alayrac J.B., Recasens A., Schneider R., Self-supervised multimodal versatile networks, Neurips, (2020); Alonso-Dos-Santos M., Soto-Fuentes Y., Valderrama-Palma V.A., Determinants of mobile banking users’ loyalty, Journal of Promotion Management, 26, 5, pp. 615-633, (2020); Basaj D., Rychalska B., Dabrowski J., Goluchawski K., Synerise at Sigir Rakuten data challenge 2020: Efficient manifold density estimator for multimodal classification, Sigir E-Commerce Workshop, (2020); Beldad A., de Jong M., Steehouder M., How shall i trust the faceless and the intangible?

Faced with similar challenges in dealing with an increasingly diversified audience, the museum sector has seen changes in theory and practice, particularly in the areas of representation and meaning-making. While rarity and grandeur used to be at the centre stage of the early museum practices, folk life and museums' relationships with the diverse communities they serve become a widely integrated part of the contemporary practices. These changes address issues of diversity and accessibility in order to offer more socially inclusive services. Drawing on these changes and reflecting back on the AI world, we argue that the museum experience provides useful lessons for building AI with socially inclusive approaches, especially in situations in which both a collection and access to it will need to be curated or filtered, as frequently happens in search engines, recommender systems and digital libraries. We highlight three principles: (1) Instead of upholding the value of neutrality, practitioners are aware of the influences of their own backgrounds and those of others on their work. By not claiming to be neutral but practising cultural humility, the chances of addressing potential biases can be increased. (2) There should be room for situational interpretation beyond the stages of data collection and machine learning. Before applying models and predictions, the contexts in which relevant parties exist should be taken into account. (3) Community participation serves the needs of communities and has the added benefit of bringing practitioners and communities together. © 2022 Owner/Author.","Curation; diversity; libraries; museums; social inclusion","Digital libraries; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Museums; Contemporary practices; Curation; Data collection; Design-process; Diverse community; Diversity; Machine learning algorithms; Meaning makings; Social inclusion; Theory and practice; Search engines","","","","","National Library of The Netherlands; National Science Agenda; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","Funding text 1: This work is part of the Recommender requirements for pluriform perspectives in local public libraries' project (NWA.1228.192.235) of the National Science Agenda (NWA) research programme, which is financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO).

However, the increasing diffusion of informal activities and events, supported by location-based services such as Airbnb, extends personalized recommendation to a many-to-one match-making task. Airbnb experiences, which any citizen can propose to offer geographic tours and thematic activities, are composed of at least two entities to be evaluated: the former is the experience itself (in terms of topic, cost, etc.); the latter is the host, who directly interacts with guests during the management of the planned activities. As both entities can dramatically influence guests' perceptions, they should be jointly taken into account by recommender systems. This paper presents our preliminary work aimed at extending the personalized suggestion of Cultural Heritage items to such composite objects.  © 2021 ACM.","Cultural Heritage; experience modeling; review-based recommender systems","Location based services; Recommender systems; Telecommunication services; Composite objects; Cultural heritages; Many-to-one; Match making; Natural heritages; Personalized recommendation; User experience","","","","","","","Adomavicius G., Manouselis N., Kwon Y., Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems, pp. 769-803, (2011); Al-Ghossein M., Murena P., Abdessalem T., Barre A., Cornuejols A., Adaptive collaborative topic modeling for online recommendation, Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) (RecSys '18), pp. 338-346, (2018); Ardissono L., Goy A., Petrone G., Segnan M., Torasso P., INTRIGUE: Personalized recommendation of tourist attractions for desktop and handset devices, Applied Artificial Intelligence, Special Issue on Artificial Intelligence for Cultural Heritage and Digital Libraries, 17, 8-9, pp. 687-714, (2003); Ardissono L., Petrelli D., Kuflik T., Personalization in cultural heritage: The road travelled and the one ahead, USER MODELING and USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION-The Journal of Personalization Research.

Interactive media is favored by exhibition designers because of its unique nature. However, there are still some defects in the interactive media design of digital exhibition in Art Museum. There are also many researches on Interactive Media Design in the digital exhibition of art museum based on big data, but the actual results are poor. Starting from the characteristics of interactive media, this paper explores the digital exhibition mode in line with the art museum, studies its design method and process, and uses the collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm to recommend the exhibits of the digital exhibition of the art museum to visitors, so as to improve the experience of visitors participating in the exhibition of the art museum. The survey results show that the majority of visitors to the art museum are aged between 35 and 55, and there are more local visitors than foreign visitors. We hope to use big data technology to design a digital art museum exhibition with interactive media characteristics, so as to improve the public’s sense of visiting experience. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Art Gallery; Big Data; Digital Exhibition; Interactive Media","Collaborative filtering; Design; Human computer interaction; Museums; Recommender systems; Art gallery; Art museums; Design method; Design-process; Development of science and technologies; Digital exhibition; Interactive media; Medium design; Methods and process; Museum studies; Big data","","","","","youth project of philosophy and social science research project of Hubei Provincial Department of education, (19Q197)","Acknowledgments.

The framework consists of five modules: information preparation, personalized recommendation, random placement, optimization, and user interaction. The personalized recommendation module uses neural networks to train personalized recommendation models; the random placement module includes the layout of exhibit cases in the exhibition hall and the random filling of exhibit cases with artifacts, and proposes the Placement depends on Integrated path (PIP) algorithm. The optimization module includes efficiency optimization and rendering optimization; the user interaction module includes personal information collection, roaming, map navigation, and exhibit interaction functions. The experimental results show that the layout generated by this framework has a high degree of realism, scene loading speed and smoothness of online viewing, and the efficiency of artifact screening is improved to 7 times compared with that before optimization; the user tuning results show that more than 85% of people give realistic or very realistic evaluation to the layout, and the framework and algorithm in the paper can realize the personalized recommendation of artifacts and exhibition hall layout in a realistic, effective, real-time and interactive way. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Digital museum; Layout design; Module design; Personalized recommendation; System optimization","Efficiency; Museums; Digital museums; Exhibition halls; Layout designs; Module design; Personalized recommendation; Random placement; Real-world; System optimizations; Time independents; User interaction; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Digital Collections; Aoki H., Oman C.M., Buckland D.A., Et al., Desktop-VR system for preflight 3D navigation training[J], Acta astronautica, 63, 7-10, pp. 841-847, (2008); Artusi A., Pouli T., Banterle F., Et al., Automatic saturation correction for dynamic range management algorithms[J], Signal Process Image Commun, 63, pp. 100-112, (2018); Asmar D., Pose Tracking in Augmented Reality of Cultural Heritage, Int J Comput Methods Herit Sci, 1, 1, pp. 123-131, (2017); Baker B.S., Coffman E.G., Rivest R.L., Orthogonal packings in two dimensions[J], SIAM J Comput, 9, 4, pp. 846-855, (1980); Carvajal D.A.L., Morita M.M., Bilmes G.M., Virtual museums.

Semantic trajectories can efficiently model human movement for further analysis and pattern recognition, while personalised recommender systems can adapt to constantly changing user needs and provide meaningful and optimised suggestions. This paper focuses on the investigation of open issues and challenges at the intersection of these two topics, emphasising semantic technologies and machine learning techniques. The goal of this paper is twofold: (a) to critically review related work on semantic trajectories and knowledge-based interactive recommender systems, and (b) to propose a high-level framework, by describing its requirements. The paper presents a system architecture design for the recognition of semantic trajectory patterns and for the inferencing of possible synthesis of visitor trajectories in cultural spaces, such as museums, making suggestions for new trajectories that optimise cultural experiences. © 2021 by the authors.

Depending on the individual space, those things can be books, films, music, inns, and significantly more. Normally, suggestions are in view of past client collaborations (e.g., films a client saw, lodgings a client booked, and so forth) This work in progress paper centers around news recommender frameworks. In view of the idea of information (e.g., continually new things, short thing lifetime, and so forth), proposals in view of past cooperation are particularly difficult to make. Subsequently, news recommender frameworks intensely depend on the genuine substance of information. While past work fundamentally considers one part of the substance of news stories, we together examine and talk about in this work a given corpora of news stories on three unique levels (i.e., archive level, subject level, and creator level). The generally point is to set to give the premise to an extensive news recommender framework, which comes to past exactness and considers likewise variety and luck. We exhibit that significant data can be extricated out of a given corpora, and contrasts in creator, time, and theme can be appeared. Moreover, the creator level investigation shows that records can be grouped in view of the composing style of creators. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","E-learning; Machine learning; Recommender systems; One parts; Work in progress; Text mining","","","","","","","Pang B., Lee L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis Found, Trends Inf.

While they can be of different types—e.g. collaborative, content-based, or hybrid filtering, they typically share the use of machine learning as a type of artificial intelligence able to perform predictions and profile personal taste. Drawing upon previous research in critical algorithm studies, this paper tackles the limitations of predictive content personalization and automated sorting. It does so by taking as a case study the computational art project This Recommendation System is Broken, developed in collaboration with metaLAB (at) Harvard as part of Curatorial A(i)gents (2020–2022), a series of experiments at the Harvard Art Museums exploring the interplay between A.I. and curatorial practices. While advocating for the ethical design and use of artificial intelligence, I discuss creative coding (Maeda in Creative code, Thames & Hudson Inc., New York, 2004 [1]) as a mode of engagement for artists, designers, media practitioners to take action in the development of context-sensitive algorithms that promote speculative (Dunne and Raby in Speculative everything: design, fiction and social dreaming. The MIT Press, 2013 [2]) design practices and sustainable future-making (Yelavich and Adams in Design as future-making. Bloomsbury Academic, London, GB, 2014 [3]), rather than adopting predictive or statistical models. The art project presented here challenges us to consider the biases of automated decision-making in generating instances of visibility/invisibility on media platforms and other online environments. What we might call “brokenness” is ultimately an attempt to escape the illusory quest for certainty and artificial perfection. Even more so, it is about shaping an ethic of A.I. practice and understanding how information filtering systems are transforming contemporary media cultures. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","A.I. ethics; Algorithms; Computational art; Online platforms; Recommendation systems","","","","","","Spanish innovation company Telefonica Investigacion y Desarrollo; European Commission, EC","When I was asked to reflect on AI-driven practices in application to digitized museum collections for the metaLAB’s project Curatorial A(i)gents, I started from three main points: first, the code I created had to be context-sensitive, meaning it should account for the institutional context of the collection itself. Moreover, it had to be culture-specific, meaning it should be aware of the cultural context it operates in. Finally, it should be oriented towards practices of future-making [3, 12], instead of focusing on prediction. To this regard, early studies on recommendation systems have shown that the creation of Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARS)—that is to say, inserting in the machine learning process contextual information and variables (time, location, social context)—allows for a more effective machine learning. The research on this topic includes, among others, a multiyear-long project funded by the European Union and coordinated by the Spanish innovation company Telefonica Investigacion y Desarrollo, between 2011 and 2013.

Virtual healthcare (VH) can act as a tool to address some of the care barriers, including reducing travel time, cost, and disruptions to people's lives. Conversely, VH can exacerbate inequities through unique difficulties in rural implementation, such as a lack of access to necessary infrastructure (eg internet), social supports, and technological capacity (eg devices and literacy). Issue: The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic induced a rapid shift to VH, providing new opportunities for health care while simultaneously highlighting and exacerbating inequities for people living in rural and remote settings. Equity-informed knowledge translation processes can help address these concerns. This commentary reports on an equity-informed knowledge translation process engaged by a diverse group of health researchers, community members, and practitioners in BC. Lessons learned: Informed by equity principles from the Canadian Coalition for Global Health Research, this knowledge exchange and translation process led to the co-creation of two practical tools: a set of VH appointment tip sheets and an open access report. Through stakeholder engagement and literature consultation, VH appointments were found to have many benefits for those in rural and remote communities, including expanding access to basic and specialized health services. However, some hesitation was noted when relying solely on these modes of care, as they can lack relationality, clarity, and time to process medical information. The tip sheets resulting from this process are an interactional-level tool developed to address this concern and optimize VH appointments, for rural patients and care providers. They offer the respective stakeholder group insights on how to actively prepare for and participate in inclusive virtual care. On a systems level, there is a continually echoed need for equity-based processes to ensure that VH is striking the balance of meeting rural health needs without exacerbating inequities. Additionally, incorporating the voices of rural and remote community members is essential. To help address this gap, an open-access report was compiled to serve as a smallscale example of integrating rural voices with existing literature to recommend systems-level adjustments. Overall, VH holds promise as an effective tool for addressing inequities experienced by those living in rural areas. To maximize this potential, rural and remote stakeholders must be proactively engaged and listened to throughout the processes of considering, planning, and implementing shifts in the utilization of VH options. © 2022.

It is useful for many applications such as Information retrieval (IR) and recommendation systems. This paper introduces a comparison between Offline and Online (LTR) for IR. It also proposes a novel Offline (1 + 1)-Simulated Annealing Strategy (SAS-Rank) and introduces the first Hybrid Online–Offline LTR techniques using SAS-Rank and ES-Rank with Online Dependent Click Model (DCM). SAS-Rank is a combination of Simulated Annealing method and Evolutionary Strategy. From the obtained experimental results, we can conclude that the Offline LTR techniques outperformed the well-known Online Dependent Click Model (DCM) technique. Moreover, the Hybrid Online–Offline SAS-Click outperformed the predictive ranking results on unseen data in most evaluation fitness metrics using LETOR 4 dataset compared to other approaches. On the other hand, Hybrid ES-Click is a competitive approach with SAS-Click in evolving ranking models for training and validation data. Regarding Offline LTR, the SAS-Rank outperformed the well-known ES-Rank which has been compared in previous studies with fourteen machine learning techniques. This research uses the best available Linear LTR approaches existing in the literature which are offline ES-Rank with Online DCM. The linear LTR approach output is a linear ranking model which can be represented as a vector of feature importance weights. This paper demonstrated the results and findings obtained using the LETOR 4 dataset, and Java Archive Package is provided for facilitating reproducible research. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Dependent click model; Hybrid online–offline learning; Learning to rank; Simulated annealing strategy","E-learning; Evolutionary algorithms; Learning systems; Recommender systems; Search engines; Annealing strategies; Dependent click model; Evolutionary strategies; Hybrid online–offline learning; Off-line learning; Offline; Online learning; Ranking model; Simulated annealing method; Simulated annealing strategy; Simulated annealing","","","","","Minia University, Egypt; Science and Technology Development Fund, STDF","The authors would like to thank Minia University, Egypt and STDF for their financial support for Open Access publishing in Springer Journals to pursue the research work satisfactorily and make it freely available for everyone.

While the usage of implicit feedback (i.e. user's behavior statistics) is gaining in prominence, the explicit feedback (i.e. user's ratings) remain an important data source. This is true especially for domains, where evaluation of an object does not require an extensive usage and users are well motivated to do so (e.g., video-on-demand services or library archives). So far, numerous rating schemes for explicit feedback have been proposed, ranging both in granularity and presentation style. There are several works studying the effect of rating's scale and presentation on user's rating behavior, e.g. willingness to provide feedback or various biases in rating behavior. Nonetheless, the effect of ratings granularity on RS performance remain largely under-researched. In this paper, we studied the combined effect of ratings granularity and supposed probability of feedback existence on various performance statistics of recommender systems. Results indicate that decreasing feedback granularity may lead to changes in RS's performance w.r.t. nDCG for some recommending algorithms. Nonetheless, in most cases the effect of feedback granularity is surpassed by even a small decrease in feedback's quantity. Therefore, our results corroborate the policy of many major real-world applications, i.e. preference of simpler rating schemes with the higher chance of feedback reception instead of finer-grained rating scenarios.  © 2022 ACM.","Explicit feedback granularity; Performance evaluation; Recommender systems","Behavioral research; Video on demand; Behavior statistics; Explicit feedback; Explicit feedback granularity; Implicit feedback; Performances evaluation; Rating schemes; Systems performance; User behaviors; User feedback; User rating; Recommender systems","","","","","Univerzita Karlova v Praze, UK, (GAUK-188322, SVV-260588); Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR, (22-21696S)","This paper has been supported by Czech Science Foundation (GAČR) project 22-21696S and Charles University grants SVV-260588 and GAUK-188322.

Nevertheless,learned scholars have discovered that the digital game visual style classification is inconsistent and easily modified, potentially limiting the information and leading to inaccurate visual terminologies during information discovery. Therefore, this cross-sectional study was performed to assess multiple visual style classification terms and their definitions among Malaysian game developers using the closed card sorting exercise. A total of seven professional game developers participated in an online survey that comprised thirty-five digital game case studies using a card sorting technique. They were asked to classify nineteen visual style classification terms, including psychedelic, text, illusionism, photorealism, televisualism, handicraft, caricature, celshaded, comic book (anime), watercolour, Lego, minimalism, pixel art, silhouette, bright, dark, maplike, colourful, and black and white. The Fleiss’ kappa intercoder reliability assessment was performed to measure the coders’ agreement on visual style classification, followed by the think-aloud protocol descriptive analysis to gather assessment insights into the visual style descriptions. The intercoder reliability test achieved a significantly moderate agreement based on the results. The professional game developers agreed on eighteen visual styles and rejected the bright visual style classification due to its overlapping description with the colourful visual style. The definition of ten visual style classifications was improved from the existing Video Game Metadata Schema (VGMS) description, contributing to the digital game’s coherence and consistency. This improvement will enhance visual style classification information for machine-learning-based recommendation systems for digital game distribution platforms and digital archiving. © 2023,Journal of Information and Communication Technology.

The system leverages deep learning techniques to acquire data about the visitor's position while ensuring her anonymity. Moreover, the visitor's appraisal of the artwork she observes is inferred implicitly based on the emotional reactions she expresses while watching a given artwork. We are not aware of any such recommender system proposed in the research literature. However, this system should ensure several advantages: (i) it is non-intrusive since it makes use of simple badges and off-the-shelf cameras while ensuring the anonymity of the visitor; (ii) it is independent of the type of museum; (iii) it offers personalized itineraries to visitors based on their implicitly inferred interests and preferences. Specifically, we illustrate the background and describe the architecture of the proposed system, discussing the steps required for its implementation. We also provide details of what has already been done and what remains to be done, outlining the open problems. © 2022 ACM.","Cultural heritage; deep learning; recommender systems; visitor modeling","Arts computing; Behavioral research; Deep learning; Learning systems; Museums; Cultural heritages; Deep learning; Emotion analysis; Emotional reactions; Learning techniques; Non-intrusive; Simple++; Tracking analysis; Visitor modeling; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Ardissono L., Kufik T., Petrelli D., Personalization in cultural heritage: the road travelled and the one ahead, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 22, 1, pp. 73-99, (2012); Argyle M., Non-verbal communication in Human Social Interaction, (1972); Baltrusaitis T., Robinson P., Morency L., Openface: an open source facial behavior analysis toolkit, 2016 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), pp. 1-10, (2016); Centorrino P., Corbetta A., Cristiani E., Onofri E., Managing crowded museums: Visitors fow measurement, analysis, modeling, and optimization, Journal of Computational Science, 53, (2021); Colace F., De Santo M., Lombardi M., Santaniello D., CHARS: A Cultural Heritage Adaptive Recommender System, Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Workshop on Technology Enablers and Innovative Applications for Smart Cities and Communities, pp. 58-61, (2019); D'Agostino D., Gasparetti F., Micarelli A., San-Sonetti G., A social context-aware recommender of itineraries between relevant points of interest, HCI International 2016-Posters' Extended Abstracts, Constantine Stephanidis (Ed.), 618, pp. 354-359, (2016); D'Aniello G., Gaeta M., Orciuoli F., Sansonetti G., Sorgente F., Knowledge-based smart city service system, Electronics (Switzerland), 9, 6, pp. 1-22, (2020); Eisenbarth H., Alpers G.W., Happy mouth and sad eyes: scanning emotional facial expressions, Emotion, 11, 4, (2011); Ferrato A., Limongelli C., Mezzini M., Sansonetti G., Exploiting Micro Facial Expressions for More Inclusive User Interfaces, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2903, (2021); Ferrato A., Limongelli C., Mezzini M., Sansonetti G., Using Deep Learning for Collecting Data about Museum Visitor Behavior, Applied Sciences, 12, 2, (2022); Gasparetti F., Sansonetti G., Micarelli A., Community detection in social recommender systems: a survey, Applied Intelligence, 51, 6, pp. 3975-3995, (2021); Guarnera M., Hichy Z., Cascio M.I., Carrubba S., Facial expressions and ability to recognize emotions from eyes or mouth in children, Europe's Journal of Psychology, 11, 2, (2015); Jack R.E., Garrod O.G.B., Yu H., Caldara R., Schyns P.G., Facial expressions of emotion are not culturally universal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 109, 19, pp. 7241-7244, (2012); Kuruvayil S., Palaniswamy S., Emotion recognition from facial images with simultaneous occlusion, pose and illumination variations using meta-learning, Journal of King Saud University-Computer and Information Sciences, 2021, (2021); Lanir J., Kufik T., Sheidin J., Yavin N., Leiderman K., Segal M., Visualizing museum visitors' behavior: Where do they go and what do they do there?, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 21, 2, pp. 313-326, (2017); Marsh A., Elfenbein H., Ambady N., Nonverbalaccents"" cultural diferences in facial expressions of emotion, Psychological Science, 14, 4, pp. 373-376, (2003); Osterman M., Thirunarayanan M., Ferris E.C., Pabon L.C., Paul N., Berger R., Museums and Twitter: An exploratory qualitative study of how museums use Twitter for audience development and engagement, Journal of Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia, 21, 3, pp. 241-255, (2012); Posner J., Russell J.A., Peterson B.S., The circumplex model of afect: An integrative approach to afective neuroscience, cognitive development, and psychopathology, Development and Psychopathology, 17, 3, pp. 715-734, (2005); Sansonetti G., Point of Interest Recommendation Based on Social and Linked Open Data, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 23, 2, pp. 199-214, (2019); Sansonetti G., Gasparetti F., D'Aniello G., Micarelli A., Unreliable Users Detection in Social Media: Deep Learning Techniques for Automatic Detection, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 213154-213167, (2020); Sansonetti G., Gasparetti F., Micarelli A., Cross-Domain Recommendation for Enhancing Cultural Heritage Experience, Adjunct Publication of the 27th ACM UMAP Conference (Larnaca, Cyprus, pp. 413-415, (2019); Sansonetti G., Gasparetti F., Micarelli A., Cena F., Gena C., Enhancing Cultural Recommendations through Social and Linked Open Data, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 29, 1, pp. 121-159, (2019); Seidenari L., Baecchi C., Uricchio T., Ferracani A., Bertini M., Del Bimbo A., Deep Artwork Detection and Retrieval for Automatic Context-Aware Audio Guides, ACM Trans.

Each movie in the industry consists of different elements such as actors, directors, preparation elements, posters, etc. One of the most important elements in any movie is its poster, that plays an important role in attracting the audience. Various information can be obtained from the movie poster, including the movie genre. Today, the movie genre is recognized manually. In this paper, we aim to consider the automatic detection of movie genres based on its poster. Automatic detection of movie genres can have various applications in movie archive systems, search engines, recommender systems, and more. In the proposed method of this paper, four categories of embedding features including the objects in the poster, identifying the actors, age, and gender of the actors in the poster, and their facial expressions are used. Our proposed method is compared with some outstanding previous works over the IMDB dataset poster. By incorporating an ensemble classification approach in our work, the results of our proposed method could achieve the average predicting accuracy of 92% which could outperform the previous works.  © 2021 IEEE.","Convolutional Neural Network; Ensemble classification; Movie Genre; Movie Posters; Word Embedding","Convolutional neural networks; Embeddings; Image classification; Multilayer neural networks; Search engines; Automatic Detection; Convolutional neural network; Embeddings; Ensemble classification; Features fusions; Genre classification; Movie genres; Movie industry; Movie poster; Word embedding; Motion pictures","","","","","","","Kumar Reddy G., Shriram R., Genre Classification of Telugu and English Movie Based on the Hierarchical Attention Neural Network, Int.

The methodology starts with defining the collection of batches used in the convolutional neural network. This methodology is based on frequent pattern extraction methods. The hashtags of the tweets are then learned using the convolution neural network that was applied to the collection of batches of tweets. In addition, a pruning approach should ensure that the learning process proceeds properly by reducing the number of common patterns. Besides, the evolutionary algorithm is involved to extract the optimal parameters of the deep learning model used in the learning process. This is achieved by using a genetic algorithm that learns the hyper-parameters of the deep architecture. The effectiveness of our methodology has been demonstrated in a series of detailed experiments on a set of Twitter archives. From the results of the experiments, it is clear that the proposed method is superior to the baseline methods in terms of efficiency. © 2022 The Author(s)","Deep learning; Multimedia and social network; Pattern recommendation; Tweet data","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network architecture; Parameter estimation; Recommender systems; Social networking (online); Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Hashtags; Hybrid architectures; Learning process; Multimedia data; Multimedium and social network; Pattern extraction method; Pattern recommendation; Tweet data; Genetic algorithms","","","","","","","Belhadi A., Djenouri Y., Lin J.C.-W., Zhang C., Cano A., Exploring pattern mining algorithms for hashtag retrieval problem, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 10569-10583, (2020); Kumar N., Baskaran E., Konjengbam A., Singh M., Hashtag recommendation for short social media texts using word-embeddings and external knowledge, Knowl.

For tourism domain, the key information is to know about how tourists choose where to go and what to do. In the past, questionnaires and surveys were commonly used. However, with the present advanced technology to get faster and easier, more convenient information is utilized. This study proposes an effective game for identifying travelers' behaviors in the chosen tourist sites in Chiang Mai. The game development process follows the Doppler Interactive game development life cycle and the game designed uses the UX/UI design laws, such as Fitts' Law, Hick's Law and Gestalt theory. The researchers separated the tourism photos into six groups: nightlife party, cultural heritage religions, city shopping, nature animal, adventure hard sport and healthy soft sport. We used cartoon pictures to identify what travelers liked to do most. Then, we gave questionnaires to compare if what the travelers clicked on the game was the same as what they answered in the questionnaires. The results were the game took only 1.42 minutes to identify travelers' preference and game accuracy was 74.33%. © 2020 IEEE.","Game Design; Tourist Behavior; UX/UI Design","Arts computing; Life cycle; Recommender systems; Sports; Surveys; Tourism; Advanced technology; Chiang Mai; Cultural heritages; Game development; Gestalt theory; Hard sports; Hick's laws; Interactive games; Software design","","","","","","","The World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), Tourism Definition; Office, T.N.S., Thailand Tourism Statistics, (2019); Swarbrooke J., Horner S., Consumer Behaviour in Tourism, (2007); Jia Z., Et al., User-based Collaborative Filtering for Tourist Attractionrecommendations. in 2015 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology, (2015); Khusro S., Ali Z., Ullah I., Recommender Systems: Issues, Challenges, and Research Opportunities, in Information Science and Applications (ICISA), 2016, pp. 1179-1189, (2016); Laamarti F., Eid M., Saddik A.E., An overview of serious games, International Journal of Computer Games Technology, 2014, (2014); Brooke J., SUS-A quick and dirty usability scale, Usability Evaluation in Industry, 189, 194, pp. 4-7, (1996); Phan M.H., Keebler J.R., Chaparro B.S., The development andvalidation of the game user experience satisfaction scale (GUESS), Human Factors, 58, 8, pp. 1217-1247, (2016); Ramadan R., Widyani Y., Game development life cycle guidelines, 2013 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS), (2013); Achmad K.A., Nugroho L.E., Djunaedi A., Tourism contextual information for recommender system, 2017 7th International Annual Engineering Seminar (InAES), (2017); McKercher B., Towards a taxonomy of tourism products, Tourism Management, 54, pp. 196-208, (2016); Skinner B.F., Contingencies of Reinforcement: A Theoretical Analysis, 3, (2014); Kohler W., Gestalt Psychology, (1929); Fitts P.M., The information capacity of the human motor system in controlling the amplitude of movement, Journal of Experimental Psychology, 47, 6, (1954); Hick W.E., On the rate of gain of information, Quarterly Journal Ofexperimental Psychology, 4, 1, pp. 11-26, (1952); Likert R., A technique for the measurement of attitudes, Archives of Psychology, (1932); Brooke J., SUS: A retrospective, Journal of Usability Studies, 8, 2, pp. 29-40, (2013)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","5th Joint International Conference on Digital Arts, Media and Technology with 3rd ECTI Northern Section Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, ECTI DAMT and NCON 2020","11 March 2020 through 14 March 2020","Section","159694","","978-172816398-7","","","English","Jt.

Many sources started publishing digital versions of news articles online to vast users through a variety of devices, i.e. television channels, magazines, and newspapers. It is observed that the news articles available can be very huge and recommendation systems can help to recommend relevant news to the news readers by filtering news articles based on some predefined criteria or similarity measure, i.e. collaborative filtering or content-based filtering approach. The paper presents named entities based similarity measure for linking digital news stories published in various newspapers during the preservation process in a digital news stories archive to ensure future accessibility. The study compares the similarity of news articles based on human judgment with a similarity value computed automatically using the proposed technique.

Multimedia data with low-level features should be represented in a high-level concept that is easily understood by a human. Classification of the multi-format object is a technique that is used to represent a multi-source object like text, image, audio, and video at once. The object t features are extracted then categorized in several specified classes or concepts. This paper adopts Deep Learning Techniques: (1) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) techniques for classifying an image, audio, and video, (2) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) technique for classifying text. The experiment uses small data of Indonesian cultural heritage domain. As supervised learning form, the output model is grouped into five classes based on Indonesian ethnic groups (Toraja, Bali, Batak, Dayak, Betawis. The result, this classification model can be implemented in the Multimedia Information Retrieval System and Recommender System for Indonesia Cultural Heritage. © 2018 IEEE.","Classification multi-format Object; Convolutional neural network; Cultural Heritage; Deep learning; Recurrent neural network","Classification (of information); Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Recommender systems; Search engines; Text processing; Classification models; Convolutional neural network; Cultural heritages; Learning techniques; Low-level features; Multimedia data; Multimedia information retrieval systems; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Recurrent neural networks","","","","","","","Zhang H., Patel V.M., Chellappa R., Hierarchical Multimodal Metric Learning for Multimodal Classification.; Lecun Y., Bengio Y., Deep Learning-review.; Srivastava N., Salakhutdinov R., Multimodal learning with deep boltzmann machines, Adv.

In this paper we focus on the knowledge domain of iconography, which is quite complex, difficult to understand and not commonly known. The use case for a knowledge-based recommender system in this knowledge domain is the exploration of a museum collection of historical artworks. The relevancy scores for the concepts of an artwork should help the user to understand the iconographic interpretation and to navigate the collection based on personal interests.

In contrast to hard skills or cognitive ability, which are the mainstream of formal and informal education, NCS is yet to be recognised and measured in academic curriculums, despite that many studies have shown the importance of NCS in building the character of a person. The system requirements and design architecture for an ICT solution are sought in this study that can quantify and assess NCS. A Design Science Approach (DSA) is followed in systematically eliciting the requirements and hence the functionalities and main modules of the ICT enabler. The resulting artefact includes the functionalities for a dashboard that the personal profile and skills of users can be visualised, and a matching system of NCS required for prospective occupations, together with a recommender system that can recommend courses to acquire NCS. The requirements were elicited and refined, starting in a co-creation session with project stakeholders from six European countries. The elicited requirements from the co-creation session were validated by pilots consisting of 190 participants from three European countries. Finally, the results were transformed into wireframes, and, ranked based on the perceptions of the end-user focus group participants, refined by the experts in the field. The discovered system features include visualisation of skills profiles of individual users, with an ability to upgrade the profile autonomously as they complete courses or assessment tests in the platform. The ICT enabler is designed under a project of European Commission Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content & Technology (DG CONNECT), named SkillsMatch. © The Authors, 2019.

The main issue in e-tourism is to determine the most suitable tourist resources from the many available for use by a particular user. Recommender systems in e-tourism provide the mechanism of satisfying customized users’ requirements by supplying them with adequate information about travel resources and services. The implementation of tourist goals can be carried out by a variety of different combinations of travel services. The optimal selection of services is a complex multi-alternative task due to the lack of data about the quality of services and the complexity of the description of user preferences. The paper considers the possibility of using fuzzy logic to the development of the e-tourism support system. Based on user profile data, web services that provide information about travel services, and ratings of services by other users, the system evaluates various alternatives of service’s composition and selects the recommended objects (hotels, flights, restaurants, car rental, museums, etc.). The service-oriented paradigm has been proposed to model the composition of tourism services, and fuzzy logic is used to evaluate the quality and compliance of tourism services with user requests and preferences. The proposed fuzzy logic-based approach analyzes the quality of travel services for personal recommendations to the tourist. The proposed model can provide decision support to users to select the most appropriate travel services and to plan a trip. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The manual task of retrieving high-quality publications based on the evidence pyramid levels, however, presents a major bottleneck in researchers' workflows. In this paper, we propose an 'evidence-based' recommender system namely, KnowCOVID-19 that utilizes an edge computing service to integrate recommender modules for data analytics using end-user thin-clients. The edge computing service features chatbot-based web interface that handles a given COVID-19 publication dataset using two recommender system modules: (i) evidence-based filtering that observes domain specific topics across the literature and classifies the filtered information according to a clinical category, and (ii) social filtering that allows diverse experts with similar objectives to collaborate via a 'social plane' to jointly find answers to critical clinical questions to fight the pandemic. We compare the Domain-specific Topic Model (DSTM) used in our evidence-based filtering with state-of-the-art models considering the CORD-19 dataset (a COVID-19 publication archive) and show improved generalization effectiveness as well as knowledge pattern query effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a comparison study between a manual literature review process and the KnowCOVID-19 augmented process, and evaluate the benefits of our information retrieval techniques over important queries provided by COVID-19 clinical experts.  © 2013 IEEE.","COVID-19 publication analytics; literature review automation; machine learning; recommender system; social networking","Data Analytics; Edge computing; Information filtering; Publishing; Clinical researchers; Comparison study; Computing services; Health care professionals; Knowledge patterns; Literature reviews; Social filtering; State of the art; Recommender systems","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (OAC-1827177, OAC-2006816)","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Award OAC-2006816 and Award OAC-1827177.","PubMed, (2020); LitCovid, (2020); Murad M.H., Asi N., Alsawas M., Alahdab F., New evidence pyramid, Evidence Based Med., 21, 4, pp. 125-127, (2016); Timm D., Evidence matters, J.

The wide-spread use of mobile devices and location-based Internet services (e.g., Google Maps) gives the opportunity to collect user locations. Taking advantage of a multi-agent system, this work proposes an approach providing users with personalised recommendations of places of interests, such as libraries, museum, restaurants, etc. The approach offers a better experience by giving additional dynamic data (e.g. popularity, as number of users) to a list of Points Of Interest (POIs), and by exploring their temporal relations. Indeed, for POIs, which we determine using a DBSCAN algorithm, we take into account the time slots when the users visited them, to offer a more advanced service. Finally, the approach was designed to preserve the privacy of users, i.e. it does not reveal the position of users. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

The research aims to accelerate and improve the quality of adaptive CH re-use. The complexity of the problem derives from some causes of different nature: lack of attention to this problem from the public administration and private investors; decision-making processes complicated by the need to connect with experts, located in different countries. Most professionals, related to the CH management, cannot access detailed data about already existing successful initiatives. The specific objective and goal of the research is the creation of an AI framework and eco-system for supporting the development and implementation of innovative business and governance models to fill up the investment gap in the adaptive re-use practices. The paper shortly describes the first steps for creating a platform designed and developed to assist and advice public entities, networked experts, private entrepreneurs and citizens in actions aiming at the valorisation of the historic and CH asset and its integration in different groups of countries to boost growth, job opportunities and social benefits, under overall sustainability constraints. The technical solutions here adopted are based on convergent methodology and networked expertise (e-expertise) technology, open data models and active knowledge extraction and processing, machine learning, collective intelligence, recommendation systems and predictive analytics, CH adaptive re-use, innovation business, and models and case-based reasoning methods. Examples of case studies giving the inception for the project components are given. © 2018 The author(s).","Adaptive re-use; Artificial intelligence; Assistant system; Cultural heritage; Decision-making; Networked model","Artificial intelligence; Cyber Physical System; Decision making; Embedded systems; Engineering education; Learning systems; Predictive analytics; Privatization; Public administration; Adaptive re use; Artificial intelligence technologies; Assistant system; Collective intelligences; Cultural heritages; Decision making process; Knowledge extraction; Technical solutions; Case based reasoning","","","","","","","Aggarwal C.C., Knowledge-based recommender systems, Recommender Systems, pp. 167-197, (2016); Alonso J., Martin J., Conservación Del Patrimonio Histórico En España, Análisis Económico (Conservation of Cultural Heritage in Spain.

This is markedly suggested by their adoption by major industry parties in a wide variety of domains. The application of recommender systems in the Cultural Heritage domain has appeared relatively recently, particularly during the advent of the 21st century. Nevertheless, a large number of works appeared in the scientific literature, driven primarily from large-scale cultural heritage collaborative projects. This paper presents a review of the current recommender system approaches, including some basic mathematical formalism, and focuses on recommender system applications in Cultural Heritage, to identify the advantages, the benefits and prospects, the disadvantages and pitfalls. The paper discusses the diversity and some common assumptions in the reviewed works, outlines some proposals for future development, and takes a position on the way forward. © 2018","Artificial intelligence; Cultural heritage; Machine learning; Museum guide; Recommendation; Recommender system","","","","","","European Commission, EC","The present work was supported by the project “Computational Science and Technologies: Data, Content and Interaction/Technologies for Content Analysis in Culture”, MIS code 5002437, co-financed by Greece and European Union in the framework of the Operational Programme “Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation” 2014-2020.","Adomavicius G., Tuzhilin A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: a survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions, IEEE Trans.

In many places around the world, an important part of this cultural heritage has been catalogued by initiatives backed by governments and organisations. However, as of today, most of this data has been mostly unknown, or of difficult access, to the general public. In this paper, we present research that aims to leverage this data to promote tourism. Our first field of application focuses on the French Pyrenees. In order to achieve our goal, we worked on two fronts: (i) the ability to export this data from their original databases and data models to well-known open data platforms; and (ii) the proposition of an open-source algorithm and framework capable of recommending a sequence of cultural heritage points of interests (POIs) to be visited by tourists. This itinerary recommendation approach is original in many aspects: it not only considers the user preferences and popularity of POIs, but it also integrates different contextual information about the user as well as the relevance of specific sequences of POIs (strong links between POIs). The ability to export the cultural heritage data as open data and to recommend sequences of POIs are being integrated in a first prototype. © 2019 by the authors.","Context awareness; Hybrid recommender systems; Itinerary recommendation; Tourism recommendation","","","","","","European Regional Development Fund, FEDER, (DATRM -SRMT 16009458 / MP0014253)","Author Contributions: Conceptualization: Landy Rajaonarivo and André Fonteles; Discussion for the improvement of the proposed approaches: Christian Sallaberry, Marie-Noëlle Bessagnet, Annig Le Parc Lacayrelle, Philippe Roose, Patrick Etcheverry and Christophe Marquesuzaà; Implementation of the proposed ideas: Landy Rajaonarivo, André Fonteles, Cécile Cayèré and Quentin Coudert; Implementation and study of experiments: Marie-Noëlle Bessagnet and Cécile Cayèré; Writing-original draft: Christian Sallaberry and Landy Rajaonarivo; Writing—Review and Editing: André Fonteles, Christian Sallaberry, Landy Rajaonarivo, Marie-Noëlle Bessagnet, Annig Le Parc Lacayrelle, Philippe Roose, Patrick Etcheverry and Christophe Marquesuzaà Funding: This research was funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), grant number DATRM -SRMT 16009458 / MP0014253.

The proposed methodology presents a customized suggestion framework, which makes utilization of item representations and also client profiles created based on ontology. The domain ontology helps the recommender to improve the personalization: from one perspective, client’s interests are displayed in an increasingly powerful and precise route by applying an area based derivative technique; on the other side, the stemmer algorithm derived content-based filtering approach, gives an evaluation of resemblance among a thing and a client, upgraded by applying a semantic likeliness strategy. Recommender frameworks and web personalize were assumed by Web usage mining as a critical job. The proposed strategy is s successful framework dependent on ontology and web usage mining. Extricating highlights from web reports and building applicable ideas is the initial step of the methodology. At that point manufacture metaphysics for the site exploit the ideas and huge terms separated from reports. As per the semantic similitude of web archives to bunch them into various semantic topics, the distinctive subjects suggest diverse inclinations.

In recent years, recommender systems (RS) emerge as an effective mechanism to tackle the information overloading problems. By exploiting the cloud computing paradigm, RS discovers interesting new cultural items based on user preferences and interests. Recent investigations on RS reveal that employing social network data can yield enhanced personalised recommendations with better prediction accuracy. Since users tend to visit only conventional monuments, and many charming cultural items are hidden from them due to lack of awareness about the cultural sites. This article proposes a personalised recommendation model in the field of cultural heritage (CH) with the help of the cloud computing environment. The experimental results obtained demonstrate the improved performance of developed RS in the area of cultural heritage tourism services.

We aim to provide easy access to these entries. Therefore, we maintain different index structures, including a formula index. To optimize the findability of the entries in our database, we continuously investigate new approaches to satisfy the information needs of our users. We believe that the findings from the ARQMath evaluation will generate new insights into which index structures are most suitable to satisfy mathematical information needs. Search engines, recommender systems, plagiarism checking software, and many other added-value services acting on databases such as the arXiv and zbMATH need to combine natural and formula language. One initial approach to address this challenge is to enrich the mostly unstructured document data via Entity Linking. The ARQMath Task at CLEF 2020 aims to tackle the problem of linking newly posted questions from Math Stack Exchange (MSE) to existing ones that were already answered by the community. To deeply understand MSE information needs, answer-, and formula types, we performed manual runs for tasks 1 and 2. Furthermore, we explored several formula retrieval methods: For task 2, such as fuzzy string search, k-nearest neighbors, and our recently introduced approach to retrieve Mathematical Objects of Interest (MOI) with textual search queries. The task results show that neither our automated methods nor our manual runs archived good scores in the competition. However, the perceived quality of the hits returned by the MOI search particularly motivates us to conduct further research about MOI.

These items can be books, movies, restaurants, and things to which individuals have different preferences. These systems help users to decide on the appropriate items and facilitate the task of finding a favorite collection items. The aim of this project is to create a system of recommendation based on textual documents, exactly will create an application making the recommendation of the mentor and the committee automatically based on the proposal of the topic and documents that are in the archive database. The algorithms that we have used are Rake which used to extract the keyword through textual documents and Leveshtein distance algorithm. This algorithm used to derive the similarity between documents based on keyword extraction that have the textual documents. Initially, the student must apply the system to be registered on the database, after applying the system extract the keywords from the document applied and compares with the proposals of the topics that are in the archive of data base and in the end brings us automatically appropriate mentor for the topic and the commission.  © 2021 IEEE.","Customizing users; Data mining; RAKE; Recommendation System; Text mining","Recommender systems; Customizing user; Data base; Distance algorithm; Document-based; Documents analysis; Keywords extraction; RAKE; Social entities; Textual documents; Data mining","","","","","","","Amatriain X., Jaimes A., Oliver N., Pujol J.M., Data Mining Methods for Recommender Systems, Hardcover, (2011); Asanov D., Algorithms and Methods in Recommender Systems, (2011); Beel J., Gipp B., Langer S., Breitinger C., Research-Paper Recommender Systems: A Literature Survey International Journal on Digital Libraries, pp. 4-47, (2015); Avar I., Kavran Z., Joli N., Anelovi N., Cviti I., Govi M., Content-based recommender system for textual documents written in croatian, On the Second International Conference on Data Analytics, (2013); Pazzani M.J., Billsus D., Content-based Recommendation Systems; Van Meteren R., Van Someren M., Using content-based filtering for recommendation, On NetlinQ Group, (2010); Melville P., Sindhwani V., Recommender Systems; Ricci F., Rokach L., Shapira B., Introduction to Recommender Systems, pp. 1-35, (2011); Lops P., De Gemmis M., Semeraro G., Content-based Recommender Systems: State of the Art and Trends, (2011); Ujwala W., Sheetal V., Debajyoti M., A Hybrid Web Recommendation System Based on the Improved Association Rule Mining Algorithm, (2013); Manning C.D., Raghavan P., Schutze H., Introduction to Information Retrieval, (2008); Sandhya Dhe N., Govardhan A., Analysis of similarity measures for text clustering, International Journal of Data Engineering, 2, 4, pp. 1-10, (2013)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","29th National Conference with International Participation, TELECOM 2021","28 October 2021 through 29 October 2021","Sofia","176125","","978-166543344-0","","","English","Natl.

Many researchers have conducted studies on the use of recommendation systems in online learning. However, until now, several similar studies still focus on the accuracy of the prediction results. Various obstacles were encountered related to changes in the face to face learning process into online learning. This study uses the User-Item Collaborative Filtering method to predict student learning outcomes as a basis for providing recommendations to students. Data on student online learning outcomes were extracted using several methods as a basis for determining and assessing their learning outcomes. The dataset we use is dummy to match the original data. The findings of this study reveal that one of the reinforcing factors that affect student achievement in online learning is the quiz score. The students' high achievement in the quizzes was also balanced by their active involvement during the learning process. Based on the evaluation of the recommendation system, it is known that the gradient boosted tree model is the best model for predicting the final score of student online learning with an accuracy calculated using the highest correlation of 0.7 and the smallest absolute error of 13.0 and root mean square error of 17.9. Based on the results of the evaluation, this study provides recommendations in the form of material links and learning archives that are useful for students to be able to carry out independent learning. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

It consists of an interactive touch screen totem, which implements a USB camera and exploits Convolutional Neural Network to perform facial coding to measure visitors’ emotions and estimate their age and gender. Based on the detected level of emotional valence, the system associates visitors with a profile and suggests them to visit a selection of five works of art, following a specific itinerary. An extensive experimentation lasting 2 months has been carried out at the Modern Art Museum “Palazzo Buonaccorsi” of Macerata. Results evidence that the proposed system can create an interactive and emotional link with the visitors, influencing their mood in the Pre-Experience phase and in the subsequent Post-Experience phase. In particular, they highlight that the proposed system, which aims at acting as emotional leverage, has been able to improve the positiveness of the emotions experienced by the visitors. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Affective computing; Cultural heritage; Emotion recognition; Facial expression recognition","Convolutional neural networks; Exhibitions; Human computer interaction; Touch screens; User experience; Art museums; Emotional valences; USB cameras; Works of art; Museums","","","","","Cherry Merry Lab; Musei Civici di Macerata; Regione Marche","Funding text 1: Acknowledgement.

These data must be preserved for future generations, particularly with new technologies and the semantic web. Recommendation systems (RS) are intended to assist prospective users in recommending the most suitable services based on their profile and expectations. The collaborative filtering (CF), content filtering (CB) or hybrid filtering (CF) RS has shown promising results in order to explore the problems experienced especially in CH. However, there are some limitations to be resolved, mostly due to the ability of these methods to build a stable and complete framework, which can provide a complete image of the user profile and suggest the most appropriate offers. This paper presents a hybrid recommender system for SCH data; a field little explored despite its historical importance and the value it generates.

In order to recommend the desired places for the new users, to find the places with unexperienced sceneries and interesting activities. We found some difficulties in conventional studies, involving that the domain of preference analysis is too closed to the personal photo archive. Hence, in this study, we improve to expand the photo-based profiles by predicting users’ unexperienced categories of sightseeing places from the photo sets in the photo-based profiles, using a deep neural network, which learning with a sequence pattern of photos taken by different users. Because of the expanded photo-based users’ profiles including visual information of unexperienced categories, it allows the recommendation system to suggest the impressive and beautiful spots where the new users who never has the experiences in that places. In the experiment, we evaluate the feasibility of our proposed method that it can expand the photo-based user profiles for guiding the sightseeing places that is expected to influence the user before the user has interests. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","","","","","","","Wang S., Wang Y., Tang J., Shu K., Ranganath S., Liu H., What your images reveal: Exploiting visual contents for point-of-interest recommendation, WWW 2017 Proceedings of the 26Th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 391-400, (2017); Li X., Pham T.-A.N., Cong G., Yuan Q., Li X.-L., Krishnaswamy S., Where you instagram?: Associating your Instagram photoswith points of interest, CIKM, pp. 1231-1240, (2015); Gao H., Tang J., Hu X., Liu H., Content-aware point of interest recommendation on location-based social networks, AAAI, Pp. 1721–1727, (2015); Liu X., Modeling users’ dynamic preference for personalized recommendation, IJCAI 2015: Proceedings of the 24Th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1785-1791, (2015); de Meo P., Quattrone G., Ursino D., A query expansion and user profile enrichment approach to improve the performance of recommender systems operating on a folksonomy, User Model.

The planners can address multiple aspects of a visit, such as users' preferences when choosing the objects to be visited, routes between those objects, visit scheduling, or user's limitations and impairments. This paper addresses the combination of a Recommender System (RS) with a route planner. The RS takes information from the users actions, acquired from the operation of a mobile application, to compute estimated preferences relative to objects / points of interest (PoI). Then, taking into account the users' preferred PoI, the preferences returned by the RS and a certain time window, a route planner produces solutions bearing in mind three objectives to be maximized: the number of PoI visited, the estimated preference of the PoI, and the number of PoI visited from a set of fxed ones. The contribution of this work is the combination of a RS with a route optimizer, as a relatively simple computational process to enhance the visit to cultural places, including buildings (e.g., museums), cities or regions. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cultural Heritage Places; Genetic Algorithm; Recommender Systems; Route Planner","Genetic algorithms; Recommender systems; Computational process; Cultural heritages; Mobile applications; Optimizers; Route planner; Time windows; Software design","","","","","Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER","This work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), project LARSyS (UID/EEA/50009/2013), and project M5SAR I&DT n. 3322 fnanced by CRESC ALGARVE2020, PORTUGAL2020 and FEDER.

In order to build recommender systems, organizations log the item consumption in their user sessions by using different sensors. For instance, Web sites use Web data loggers, museums and shopping centers rely on user in-door positioning systems to register user movement, and Location-Based Social Networks use Global Positioning System for out-door user tracking. Most organizations do not have a detailed history of previous activities or purchases by the user. Hence, in most cases recommenders propose items that are similar to the most recent ones viewed in the current user session. The corresponding task is called session based, and when only the last item is considered, it is referred to as item-to-item recommendation. A natural way of building next-item recommendations relies on item-to-item similarities and item-to-item transitions in the form of “people who viewed this, also viewed” lists. Such methods, however, depend on local information for the given item pairs, which can result in unstable results for items with short transaction history, especially in connection with the cold-start items that recently appeared and had no time yet to accumulate a sufficient number of transactions. In this paper, we give new algorithms by defining a global probabilistic similarity model of all the items based on Random Fields. We give a generative model for the item interactions based on arbitrary distance measures over the items, including explicit, implicit ratings and external metadata to estimate and predict item-to-item transition probabilities. We exploit our new model in two different item similarity algorithms, as well as a feature representation in a recurrent neural network based recommender. Our experiments on various publicly available data sets show that our new model outperforms simple similarity baseline methods and combines well with recent item-to-item and deep learning recommenders under several different performance metrics. © 2019 by the authors.

The recommender is based on a new conceptualisation of a visit and the adoption of a minimax (or 'conservative') approach towards user satisfaction modelling. The approach is based on the integration of temporal, spatial and content dynamics captured during a visit and contribute to an estimate of the user satisfaction and a development of an optimal route as a sequence of points of interest. Apollo follows a minimax approach by targeting the minimisation of the highest possible user dissatisfaction or disengagement, rather than looking for a maximisation of the user satisfaction. A considerable effort has been dedicated to the creation of realistic simulation data for items (the exhibits), users (the visitors), and a small amount of ratings of the items by some of the users with specific characteristics selected to represent a realistic scenario. Extensive visit simulations have been conducted and results show a considerable decrease of the probable user dissatisfaction in relation to a baseline recommender. © 2018 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Cultural heritage; Electronic guide; Machine learning; Recommendation; Recommender; Recommender system","Artificial intelligence; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Recommender systems; Cultural heritages; Electronic guide; Points of interest; Realistic scenario; Realistic simulation; Recommendation; Recommender; User satisfaction; Museums","","","","","European Commission, EC","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The present work was supported by the project “Computational Science and Technologies: Data, Content and Interaction/Technologies for Content Analysis in Culture”, MIS code 5002437, co-financed by Greece and European Union in the framework of the Operational Programme “Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation” 2014-2020.","Adomavicius G., Tuzhilin A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-The-art and possible extensions, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17, 6, pp. 734-749, (2005); Asanov D., Et al., Algorithms and Methods in Recommender Systems, (2011); Melville P., Sindhwani V., Recommender systems, Encyclopedia of Machine Learning.

Tracking of visits in a museum environment is an expensive task if performed without automatic tracking systems. For this reason, many automatic tracking systems are proposed in the research literature. However, some of them are expensive (e.g., systems based on light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology), or require active collaboration from visitors (e.g., systems based on wearable devices). In this work, we propose a deep learning object detection approach to the problem of tracking visitors. The proposed system can accurately detect specific objects in videos, thus allowing for the careful measurement of the spatial and temporal movements of a visitor in a museum scenario. The system requires only off-the-shelf inexpensive devices and deep learning models for object detection and recognition. © 2020 ACM.","deep learning; machine learning; object detection; visitors tracking","Deep learning; Museums; Object detection; Object recognition; Optical radar; Servomechanisms; Wearable technology; Automatic tracking system; Detection approach; Learning models; Learning objects; Light detection and ranging; Object detection and recognition; Object detectors; Wearable devices; Object tracking","","","","","","","Ardissono L., Kuflik T., Petrelli D., Personalization in cultural heritage: The road travelled and the one ahead, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 22, 5, pp. 73-99, (2012); Drachsler H., Verbert K., Santos O.C., Manouselis N., Panorama of recommender systems to support learning, Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 421-451, (2015); Fogli A., Sansonetti G., Exploiting semantics for context-aware itinerary recommendation, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 23, 2, pp. 215-231, (2019); He K., Zhang X., Ren S., Sun J., Deep residual learning for image recognition, 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 770-778, (2016); Huang J., Rathod V., Sun C., Zhu M., Korattikara A., Fathi A., Fischer I., Wojna Z., Song Y., Guadarrama S., Murphy K., Speed/accuracy trade-offs for modern convolutional object detectors, 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3296-3297, (2017); Krizhevsky A., Sutskever I., Hinton G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems-Volume 1 (NIPS'12), pp. 1097-1105, (2012); Lanir J., Kuflik T., Sheidin J., Yavin N., Leiderman K., Segal M., Visualizing museum visitors' behavior: Where do they go and what do they do there, Personal Ubiquitous Comput, 21, 2, pp. 313-326, (2017); LeCun Y., Bengio Y., Hinton G., Deep learning, Nature, 521, 7553, pp. 436-444, (2015); Limongelli C., Sciarrone F., Temperini M., Vaste G., The use of e-learning methodologies and technologies for generating personalised tours in cultural heritage environments, Int.

One of the recent targeted challenges is classifying music segments based on their genre, which is done according to the extracted features of their audio tracks. This identification process plays a major rule in the user-tailored recommendation systems employed by the widely used web services like Spotify and YouTube. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of feature selection combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify the recently shared open-source FMA (Free Music Archive) dataset. We use information-gain feature selection method to select the minimum number of features required for classification without affecting the accuracy of the model. We demonstrate that confining the model to use the top selected features have reduced the model complexity, and significantly reduced the processing time without sacrificing accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.","Artificial intellgence; Feature selection; Machine learning; Music genre classification; SVM-RBF","Audio acoustics; Feature extraction; Support vector machines; Web services; Feature selection methods; Identification process; Information gain; Model complexity; Music genre classification; Music segments; Open sources; Processing time; Classification (of information)","","","","","","","Dollars M., Global music industry revenue 2016 | statistic, Statista, (2017); Music genre list, The Most Comprehensive List of Genres of Music Available on the Internet 2018, (2018); Scaringellaet N., Et al., Automatic genre classification of music content: A survey, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 23, 2, pp. 133-141, (2006); Laurier C., Et al., Multimodal music mood classification using audio and lyrics, 2008 Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, pp. 688-693, (2008); Weihs C., Et al., Classification in music research, Advances in Data Analysis and Classification, 1, 3, pp. 255-291, (2007); Defferrard M., Et al., Fma: A dataset for music analysis, Arxiv.

Many research projects have been created to assist the visitor before and during his visit. The cultural heritage area is affected by the problem of information overload. With the advent of the social web, a large number of available resources have emerged coming from the social information systems SocIS. Therefore, visitors are swamped with enormous choices in their visited cities. Even though, SocIS platforms use the features of collaborative tagging, named folksonomy, to commonly contribute to the management of the shared resources. Collaborative tagging lacks semantic which reduces the effectiveness of organizing resources. It decreases their findability and discoverability, thereby their recommendation. In this paper, we aim to personalize the cultural heritage visit, i.e., to suggest semantically related places that are most likely to interest a visitor. Our proposed approach represents a semantic graph-based recommender system of cultural heritage places by (1) constructing an emergent semantic description that semantically augments the place and (2) effectively modeling the emerging graphs representing the semantic relatedness of similar cultural heritage places and their related tags. The experimental evaluation shows relevant results attesting the efficiency of our proposal applied to recommend cultural heritage of Marrakesh city. Future perspectives will focus on creating a real-world application using augmented reality. It will include a semantic-based context-aware recommender system that rises in value the cultural heritage of the touristic city by suggesting historical places that suit the visitor’s interests. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Context-awareness; Cultural heritage; Emergent semantic; Folksonomy; Graph-based recommender system; Marrakesh","Augmented reality; Graphic methods; Semantics; Context- awareness; Cultural heritages; Folksonomies; Graph-based; Marrakesh; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Lopez-Nores M., Kuflik T., Wallace M., Et al., User Model User-Adap.

The use of MDF is widespread in statistics and the applications are numerous from abundance data in ecology to recommender systems. In many cases, an MDF exhibits simultaneously main effects, such as row, column, or group effects and interactions, for which a low-rank model has often been suggested. Although the literature on low-rank approximations is very substantial, with few exceptions, existing methods do not allow to incorporate main effects and interactions while providing statistical guarantees. The present work fills this gap. We propose an estimation method which allows to recover simultaneously the main effects and the interactions. We show that our method is near optimal under conditions which are met in our targeted applications. We also propose an optimization algorithm which provably converges to an optimal solution. Numerical experiments reveal that our method, mimi, performs well when the main effects are sparse and the interaction matrix has low-rank. We also show that mimi compares favorably to existing methods, in particular when the main effects are significantly large compared to the interactions, and when the proportion of missing entries is large. The method is available as an R package on the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

In this scenario, it is possible and necessary to implement strategies for cultural heritage enhancement. This vision has become increasingly feasible due to the introduction of systems based on new technologies, particularly those based on intensive use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). This approach has allowed the development of applications to build adaptive cultural paths usable by different types of users. In addition to the technological dimension, a fundamental role is played by methodologies that convey information content innovatively and effectively. The objective of this paper is to propose a Recommender approach that aims at the enhancement of Italian Cultural Heritage. In this way, everyone could have the opportunity to know or deepen their knowledge of the cultural sites that are most suited to them, which will be presented through the narrative technique of Digital Storytelling. The Recommender methodology introduced has been tested through an experimental campaign, obtaining promising results. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Digital storytelling; E-tourism; Recommender system","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Cultural heritages; Digital storytelling; Experimental campaign; Information and Communication Technologies; Information contents; Introduction of systems; Pattern recognition","","","","","","","Colace F., Et al., How to describe cultural heritage resources in the web 2.0 era?, Proceedings-11Th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology and Internet-Based Systems, SITIS 2015, (2016); Atzori L., Iera A., Morabito G., The internet of things: A survey, Comput.

This small gathering establishes a voluntary platform to engage in activities and share experiential knowledge. Since members of a small group tend to have diverse preferences, both individual and group preferences should be considered for a cohesive and harmonious guide. This paper proposes a mixed-initiative tour path planning system for multiple visitors that builds a group path supported by automatic path generation and users' participation. In the proposed system, individual user profiles are merged into a group profile by favoring multiple users' higher preferences with low deviation. Then the system constructs a tour path based on mixed-initiative interaction that consists of the system's automatic decision and participation of members. When group members have similar preferences, a tour path is automatically decided by the system. If group members have different and divergent preferences, the system asks group members to intervene and confirm appropriate places to collaboratively construct a tour path. To show feasibility of our proposed system, we evaluate our approach in twofold consists of a synthesized group simulation and a user study. For the simulation, we collected user preferences of 12 real users to simulate groups of two, three, and four members and explored characteristics of similar and different preference scenarios. For the user study, we conducted a comparative study with 11 participants under 4 different exhibition scenarios using the implemented mixed-initiative path planning system. Evaluation results support that our system constructs a cohesive, satisfying and usable path for a small group tour.  © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

Concretely, the proposed RS (1) extracts information from Facebook by analyzing content generated by users and their friends; (2) performs disambiguation tasks through LOD tools; (3) profiles the active user as a social graph; (4) provides her with personalized suggestions of artistic and cultural resources in the surroundings of the user’s current location. The last point is performed by integrating collaborative filtering algorithms with semantic technologies in order to leverage LOD sources such as DBpedia and Europeana. Based on the recommended points of cultural interest, the proposed system is also able to suggest to the active user itineraries among them, which meet her preferences and needs and are sensitive to her physical and social contexts as well. Experimental results on real users showed the effectiveness of the different modules of the proposed recommender. © Springer Nature B.V. 2019.","Cultural heritage; Linked open data; Recommender systems; Social network","Collaborative filtering; Linked data; Recommender systems; Semantics; Social networking (online); Collaborative filtering algorithms; Cultural heritages; Cultural resources; Hybrid recommender systems; Linked open data (LOD); Linked open datum; Semantic technologies; Social context; Open Data","","","","","","","Albanese M., D'Acierno A., Moscato V., Persia F., Picariello A., A multimedia semantic recommender system for cultural heritage applications, Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Semantic Computing, pp. 403-410, (2011); Antoniou G., Groth P., Harmelen F.V.V., Hoekstra R., A Semantic Web Primer, (2012); Ardissono L., Kuflik T., Petrelli D., Personalization in cultural heritage: The road travelled and the one ahead, User Model User Adapt.

One of the applications of social robots is as recommendation systems. Previous research has mainly investigated how persuasive recommendations can be improved by focusing on the non-verbal/verbal behavior of robots. However, to use robots as recommendation systems every day, it is extremely important to examine the persistence of repeated persuasion over a long term, rather than the effect of one-time persuasion. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the persistence of repeated persuasive of robots. For this purpose, robots with three types of behavior (Expert Behavior, Local Behavior, and Growth Behavior) recommended nutrition bars in a situation of daily consumption behavior for two weeks. We could confirm significant differences in the persistent persuasiveness in each behavior. The results suggested that the combination of value co-creation using local information and meta-trust expression had a significant impact on the persistence of the repeated persuasiveness of the robots in the longitudinal period. However, the acceptance of the recommendation robot system decreased due to the increase in the amount of information during recommendation; therefore, a new recommend system to solve this problem is desired.  © 2021 IEEE.","","Robots; Amount of information; Daily lives; Growth behavior; Local information; Persuasion strategy; Robots system; Social robots; Value co creations; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Yamazaki K., Et al., Home-assistant robot for an aging society, Proc. the IEEE, 100, 8, pp. 2429-2441, (2012); Chidambaram V., Chiang Y., Mutlu B., Designing persuasive robots: How robots might persuade people using vocal and nonverbal cues, Proc.

In this context, the use of information systems might bring some benefits for tourists, for example, by helping people to select tourist attractions, such as restaurants, beaches, and museums. In this paper, we perform two evaluations of 22 recommendation algorithms provided by existing recommendation system libraries, aiming to identify efficient algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy. In the first evaluation, we compare the algorithms by measuring different metrics, such as RMSE, MAE, precision, recall, and F1 Score. In the second evaluation, we compare the recommendation algorithms based on the answers of 172 people that participated in our survey by evaluating different kinds of tourist attractions. The results of our study show that some recommendation algorithms remain on the top list with regards to efficiency on both studies, such as the SVD++, Baseline Only, and KNN Z Score with Pearson Baseline Similarity. Others are efficient in the first evaluation, or for some metrics, but not in the second study, for example, or the other way around. The results of our study are useful for people that are creating solutions in the tourism domain. © 2020 Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

The aim of this paper is to introduce a recommender system capable of developing adaptive tourist routes. In fact, the proposed system suggests points of interest and related services according to both the profile of the tourist and contextual aspects. In particular, the interaction of the user with the system occurs through a chatbot that allows to build a real dialog.

Conventionally, user representations are generated purely in the offline stage. Without referencing to the specific candidate item for recommendation, it is difficult to fully capture user preference from the perspective of interest. More recent algorithms tend to generate user representation at runtime, where user's historical behaviors are attentively summarized w.r.t. the presented candidate item. In spite of the improved efficacy, it is too expensive for many real-world scenarios because of the repetitive access to user's entire history. In this work, a novel user representation framework, Hi-Fi Ark, is proposed. With Hi-Fi Ark, user history is summarized into highly compact and complementary vectors in the offline stage, known as archives. Meanwhile, user preference towards a specific candidate item can be precisely captured via the attentive aggregation of such archives. As a result, both deployment feasibility and superior recommendation efficacy are achieved by Hi-Fi Ark. The effectiveness of Hi-Fi Ark is empirically validated on three real-world datasets, where remarkable and consistent improvements are made over a variety of well-recognized baseline methods. © 2019 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

In combination with the new information management system ZONTAL Space (ZS), archiving with the ADF is compared with currently used systems CONTENTdm and ROSETTA. Design/methodology/approach: The approach is a workflow-based comparison in terms of usability, functionality and reliability of the systems. Current workflows are replaced by optimized target processes, which limit the number of involved parties and process steps. The connectors or manual solutions between the current workflow steps are replaced with automatic functions inside of ZS. Reporting functionalities inside of ZS are used to track system and file lifecycle to ensure stability and data preservation. Findings: The authors find that the target processes leveraging ZS drastically reduce complexity compared to current workflows. Archiving with the ADF is found to decrease integration complexity and provide a more robust data migration path for the future. The possibility to enrich data automatically with metadata and to store this information alongside the content in the same information package increases reusability of the data. Research limitations/implications: The practical implications of this work suggest the arrival of a new information management system that can potentially revolutionize the archiving landscape within libraries. Beyond the scope of the initial proof of concept, the potential for the system can be seen to replace existing data management tools and provide access to new data analytics applications, like smart recommender systems. Originality/value: The value of this study is a systematic introduction of ZS and the ADF, two emerging solutions from the Pharmaceutical Industry, to the broader audience of digital preservation experts within US libraries. The authors consider the exchange of best practices and solutions between industries to be of high value to the communities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Allotrope; Data preservation; Digital archiving; Digitization; OAIS; ZONTAL space","Analog to digital conversion; Data Analytics; Digital image storage; Digital libraries; Libraries; Life cycle; Reusability; Allotrope; Data preservations; Digital Archiving; OAIS; ZONTAL space; Information management","","","","","","","Alter A., Peled I., Managing and Preserving Research Data in Ex Libris Rosetta, (2015); Folk M., Heber G., Koziol Q., Pourmal E., Robinson D., An overview of the HDF5 technology suite and its applications, Proceedings of the EDBT/ICDT 2011 Workshop on Array Databases, pp. 36-47, (2011); Giaretta D.A.D.W.G., (2012); Kagermann H., Change through Digitization – Value Creation in the Age of Industry 4.0.

Getting the appropriate lecture video out of all video archives available on the internet is not an easy task. Analyzing the video title, description and other static metadata contents is not sufficient to find the relevance of a video. This paper presents an approach for lecture video analysis based on the content of the video. We apply video segmentation to retrieve the frames from given video at specific time interval. Then we retrieve keywords from the frames using OCR technology. At the same time ASR technique extract textual metadata from audio track of the video which is easily separable from video. On the basis of retrieved keywords web links, image links and YouTube links are provided. Users can access the related videos using provided links and they can give rating for viewed video according to the relevance of that video. This rating is helpful for further attempts of finding the relevance of video. Recommendation system is the major part of this research which is implemented using cosine similarity and Pearson correlation score. © 2017 IEEE.","ASR; Lecture video content analysis; lecture video retrieval; OCR; video recommendation","Correlation methods; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Metadata; Optical character recognition; Search engines; Cosine similarity; Effective learning; Information retrieval approach; Lecture video; Pearson correlation; Textual metadata; video recommendation; Video segmentation; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Yang H., Meinel C., Content based lecture video retrieval using speech and video text information, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 7, 2; Leeuwis E., Federico M., Cettolo M., Language modeling and transcription of the ted corpus lectures, Proc.

In the long term, the real-time analysis of visitors' gaze should allow a fine estimation of their interest for the different artworks exhibited and should replace the fastidious and time-consuming elicitation of preferences commonly used in traditional recommender systems. To study these links, we carried out a user study at the Nancy Museum of Fine Arts in the North-East of France. This pilot study involved 13 volunteers who had the opportunity to freely explore the museum and contemplate hundreds of artworks for more than 50 minutes on average in May 2018. We were able to analyze millions of fixation points so as to find correlations between the number of fixation points per painting, the time spent looking at a painting, and whether or not this painting is appreciated. We plan to extend this study to 100 visitors in the coming months. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cultural heritage; Gaze behaviour; Implicit user modelling; User study","Museums; Real time systems; Cultural heritages; Elicitation of preferences; Fixation point; Gaze behaviours; Number of fixations; Real time analysis; User Modelling; User study; Behavioral research","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020, (693150)","Funding text 1: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 693150.

As society becomes ever more digital, museums are moving towards making their collections available online to the public. However, just providing a searchable interface to the entirety of the collection could be a barrier to successful engagement. Tremendous craftsmanship is put into creating interesting and informative in-person curations of selected items, and a challenge exists in replicating this online. One solution could be the application of recommender systems, which personalise information to the individual based on their previous interactions and tastes. These systems power many popular online services, but cannot be applied without considerations and decisions being made about the data that is given to the engine. As museum collections vary in their nature and content, particular care should be taken when handling the data – standard methods may not apply. In this paper, we present the challenges of data curation in the context of using machine learning techniques with museum collections, supported by two case studies. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Data; Machine learning; Museum collection; Recommender system","Machine learning; Online systems; Case-studies; Individual-based; Machine learning techniques; Museum collections; On-line service; Vital sources; Data curation","","","","","","","Berry D.M., The post-digital.

Due to this fact, we need to improve the systems of information processing and retrieval. Moreover, recommendation systems are important tools for leading to such an improvement. Recommendation systems based on collaborative filtering may have degraded performance due to the problem known as cold start. In an attempt to solve this problem, we should recommend items based on their content. The content-based recommendation systems exploit external data sources, such as web documents or the Linked Open Data, to compare item contents. However, a few proposals make use of the semantic relationship among the items. In this work, we exploit the semantic relationship provided by Linked Open Data (LOD) to search out automatically relevant item features and propose an approach for measuring the similarity between items. This similarity measure leads to a ranked list of similar items. To evaluate our approach, we performed experiments on two domains: museums and movies. Our approach produced competitive results compared to those approaches that manually define the relevant features. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Entity Similarity; Linked Open Data; Ontology Instance; Rank correlation","Collaborative filtering; Linked data; Recommender systems; Search engines; Semantics; Content-based recommendation; Degraded performance; Entity similarities; External data sources; Linked open data (LOD); Linked open datum; Rank correlation; Semantic relationships; Open Data","","","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais, FAPEMIG; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, UFMG","This research is partially sponsored by the Federal University of Ouro Preto - UFOP, the Federal Institute of Minas Gerais - São João Evangelista Campus, the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development – CNPq, and FAPEMIG.","Alfarhood S.D., Exploiting Semantic Distance in Linked Open Data for Recommendation, (2017); Berners-Lee T., Linked Data - Design Issues, (2006); Bizer C., Heath T., Berners-Lee T., Linked Data - The story so far, International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems, 5, 3, pp. 1-22, (2009); Colucci L., Doshi P., Lee K.-L., Liang J., Lin Y., Vashishtha I., Zhang J., Jude A., Evaluating item-item similarity algorithms for movies, Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA’16), pp. 2141-2147, (2016); De Sousa P.S., Ferreira A.A., Estimating similarity among entities aided by the web when only the entity name is available, Proceedings of the 24th Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web, pp. 253-260, (2018); Noia T.D., Mirizzi R., Ostuni V.C., Romito D., Zanker M., Linked Open Data to Support Content-based Recommender Systems, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Semantic Systems (I-SEMANTICS’12), pp. 1-8, (2012); Noia T.D., Ostuni V.C., Recommender Systems and Linked Open Data, pp. 88-113, (2015); Figueroa C., Vagliano I., Rocha O.R., Mori-Sio M., A Systematic Literature Review of Linked Data-based Recommender Systems, Concurr.

Depending on the application domain, it can be a playlist of songs they are likely to enjoy in their favorite online music service, a set of educational resources to acquire new competencies through an intelligent tutoring system, or a sequence of exhibits to discover from an adaptive mobile museum guide. To make these lists coherent from the users’ perspective, recommendations must find the best compromise between multiple objectives (best possible precision, need for diversity and novelty). We propose to achieve that goal through a multi-agent recommender system, called AntRS. We evaluated our approach with a music dataset with about 500 users and more than 13,000 sessions. The experiments show that we obtain good results as regards to precision, novelty and coverage in comparison with typical state-of-the-art single and multi-objective algorithms. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multi-agent systems; Recommender systems","Ant colony optimization; Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Intelligent agents; Recommender systems; Reinforcement learning; Ant colony systems; Educational resource; Intelligent tutoring system; Multi objective algorithm; Multi-agent recommender systems; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multiple-objectives; Online music services; Multi agent systems","","","","","Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (P 33188-B); Universität Wien","The authors want to gratefully thank all participants who provided samples.

As per the personal experience and traditional knowledge, the framers recommend a suitable crop for cultivation and this prediction may go wrong several times. Therefore, fuzzy expert system designed for crop recommendation systems for archiving the efficient crop recommendation. In the traditional single-layer fuzzy system, the rule is exponentially increased when the system variables are increased and a larger rule base will affect the system performance and transparency. Therefore, the multi-layer system is developed using the fuzzy hierarchical approach. The hierarchical fuzzy model is applied in a Mamdani fuzzy inference system for a suitable crop recommendation system. The crop recommendation system has 12 input variables, and it was decomposed into six fuzzy subsystems and arranged as per the priority. The final results show that a hierarchical crop recommendation system provides better performance than traditional fuzzy crop recommendation. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Crop recommendation; Fuzzy inference system; Hierarchical fuzzy system; Rule explosion; Soil properties","Agricultural robots; Crops; Cultivation; Expert systems; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Intelligent computing; Fuzzy expert systems; Hierarchical approach; Hierarchical fuzzy systems; Mamdani fuzzy inferences; Multi-layer system; Personal experience; Sustainable agriculture; Traditional knowledge; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Deepa N, Ganesan K, Decision-making tool for crop selection for agriculture development, Neural Comput Appl, (2017); Papageorgiou IE, Markinos A, Gemptos T, Application of fuzzy cognitive maps for cotton yield management in precision farming, Expert Syst Appl, 36, pp. 12399-12413, (2009); Chen Y, Abraham A, Hierarchical fuzzy systems, tree-struc, Based Hybrid Com Intell, pp. 129-147, (2010); Dkhil MB, Wali A, Alimi AM, A hierarchical fuzzy system for an advanced driving assistance system, Comput Vision Pattern Recogn Artif Intell, (2018); Ullah I, Fayaz M, Kim DH, Risk assessment based on hierarchical fuzzy inference and prediction using Kalman filter for underground facilities in smart cities, Int J Innov Technol Explor Eng (IJITEE), 8, 3C, (2019); Lim CK, Yew KM, Ng KH, Abdullah BJJ, A proposed hierarchical fuzzy inference system for the diagnosis of arthritic diseases, Australas Phy Eng Sci Med, 25, 3, (2002); Bosma R, Kaymak U, van den Berg J, Udo H, Verreth J, Using fuzzy logic modelling to simulate farmers’ decision-making on diversification and integration in the Mekong delta, Vietnam, Soft Comput, 15, pp. 295-310, (2011); Fayaz M, Ahmad S, Hang L, Kim D, Water supply pipeline risk index assessment based on cohesive hierarchical fuzzy inference system, Processes, 7, (2019); Sindel Radek, Hierarchical Fuzzy Systems, 16th Triennial World Congress, (2005); Paulo Salgado J, Boaventura Cunha, greenhouse climate hierarchical fuzzy modelling, Control Eng Pract, 13, pp. 613-628, (2005); Lee M-L, Chung H-Y, Yu FM, Modeling of hierarchical fuzzy systems, Fuzzy Sets Syst, 138, pp. 343-361, (2003); Yager RR, On the construction of hierarchical fuzzy systems models, IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Part C: Appl Rev, 28, 1, (1998)","India","Mallick P.K.; Meher P.; Majumder A.; Das S.K.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","1st International Conference on Electronic Systems and Intelligent Computing, ESIC 2020","2 March 2020 through 4 March 2020","Yupia","249269","18761100","978-981157030-8","","","English","Lect.

In this work we are interested in the needs of people with Autism in order to support them in the exploration of a geographic area. Specifically, this paper presents a mobile tourist guide that we are developing to help people in visiting new places. The app is an evolution of PIUMA (Personalised Interactive Urban Maps for Autism), conceived to help autistic citizens in their everyday movements. It shows a map tailored to users with Autism Spectrum Disorder. In particular, it presents a personalized selection of safe Points of Interest, i.e., places that are, at the same time, interesting for the user and have ""safe"" characteristics from the sensory point of view, such as being quiet, scarcely crowded, or with smooth lights. In this paper, we present how we intend to extend PIUMA to support tourists. © 2020 ACM.","accessibility; autism spectrum disorder; cultural heritage exploration; recommender systems; tourism","Autism spectrum disorders; Cognitive capability; Content recommendations; Cultural heritages; Geographic areas; Mobile tourist guide; Points of interest; Tourist guides; Diseases","","","","","European Foundation Centre","This work is supported by the COMPAGNIA di SAN PAOLO foundation, Member of the European Foundation Centre.","Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5R), American Psychiatric Pub, (2013); Bernardes M., Barros F., Simoes M., Castelo-Branco M., A serious game with virtual reality for travel training with autism spectrum disorder, 2015 International Conference on Virtual Rehabilitation (ICVR).

As one of the important technologies in the smart space, Recommender Systems (RSs) have been widely utilised to personalised services and matching visitors’ goals and behaviours. Whereas, cultural difference is often considered a barrier to technology transfer or adoption. However, few studies focus on how the cultural factor influences recommendation despite cultural difference largely affects user preferences in the RSs. Furthermore, existing researches have mainly analysed evaluation results of their recommendation to reveal cultural differences, rather than utilising the cross-cultural factors into RSs. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of cross-cultural contextualisation and a model to compute the cross-cultural factor affecting users (countries or cultures) preferences by using matrix factorisation and clustering techniques. In addition, we discuss how to apply the model to RSs in CH domain through cross-domain recommendation techniques. Note that the two computational techniques were used to analyse cross-cultural factors which impact to user preferences, rather than to recommend items. In other words, the proposed model and computing results capable of utilisation into the other RSs as well as various research fields. Results of experiments with a real-world dataset showed effectiveness of the proposed model and supported that there is cultural difference influencing users’ rating behaviours. Furthermore, a systematic analysis of dataset and the experimental results presented that individual users could be considered as country-wise groups for the model to analyse the cross-cultural factors. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Computational analysis; Cross-cultural contextualisation; Cultural analysis; Matrix factorisation; Recommender system; Smart cultural heritage","Factorization; Technology transfer; Computational analysis; Contextualisation; Cultural analysis; Cultural heritages; Matrix factorisation; Recommender systems","","","","","Chung-Ang University, CAU; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF-2017R1A2B4010774); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF"," This research was supported by the Chung-Ang University Research Grants in 2018.

In this paper, we present a Big Data architecture supporting typical cultural heritage applications. On the top of querying, browsing, and analyzing cultural contents coming from distributed and heterogeneous repositories, we propose a novel user-centered recommendation strategy for cultural items suggestion. Despite centralizing the processing operations within the cloud, the vision of edge intelligence has been exploited by having a mobile app (Smart Search Museum) to perform semantic searches and machine-learning-based inference so as to be capable of suggesting museums, together with other items of interest, to users when they are visiting a city, exploiting jointly recommendation techniques and edge artificial intelligence facilities. Experimental results on accuracy and user satisfaction show the goodness of the proposed application. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Big Data; cultural heritage (CH); edge artificial intelligence (AI); recommender system","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Electronic commerce; Museums; Semantics; Cultural heritage application; Cultural heritages; Data architectures; edge artificial intelligence (AI); Heterogeneous repositories; Processing operations; Recommendation strategies; Recommendation techniques; Recommender systems","","","","","Ministry of Science and ICT, (2017R1E1A1A01077913); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61801166); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), (YS2017YFGH001945)","Manuscript received February 11, 2019; accepted March 7, 2019.

These systems encounter some problems the major of which is their failure in recommending long tail items. Long tail items are the ones rated by a few users, thus, their rare participation in recommendations. To overcome this problem, it is necessary to provide recommendations by considering other aspects in addition to accuracy. One of these aspects is diversity in recommendations. As to different users who may prefer different levels of diversity in recommendations, here diversification of recommendations in a personalized manner is suggested in order to increase the participation of long tail items. The recommendation list is optimized based on three objectives of increasing the accuracy, personalizing the diversity, and reducing the popularity of the recommended items to meet the purpose. The defined multi-objective optimization problem is solved through the archived multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm. The evaluation of this proposed method on the Netflix datasets reveals that this method overcomes the long tail recommendation problem and diversifies the recommendations according to user needs while maintaining an acceptable level of accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Diversity; Long tail items; Multi-objective optimization; Personalization; Recommender system; Simulated annealing","Recommender systems; Simulated annealing; Diversity; Long tail; Multi objective; Multi-objective optimization problem; Netflix; Personalizations; Simulated annealing algorithms; User need; Multiobjective optimization","","","","","","","Cheng P., Wang S., Ma J., Sun J., Xiong H., Learning to recommend accurate and diverse items, Presented at the Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web, (2017); Adomavicius G., Kwon Y., Improving aggregate recommendation diversity using ranking-based techniques, IEEE Trans.

Social media is one resource that aids personalization. This study explores the use of twitter data to personalize travel recommendations. A machine learning classification model is used to identify travel related tweets. The travel tweets are then used to personalize recommendations regarding places of interest for the user. Places of interest are categorized as: historical buildings, museums, parks, and restaurants. To better personalize the model, travel tweets of the user's friends and followers are also mined. Volunteer twitter users were asked to provide their twitter handle as well as rank their travel category preferences in a survey. We evaluated our model by comparing the predictions made by our model with the users choices in the survey. The evaluations show 68% prediction accuracy. The accuracy can be improved with a better travel-tweet training dataset as well as a better travel category identification technique using machine learning. The travel categories can be increased to include items like sports venues, musical events, entertainment, etc. and thereby fine-tune the recommendations. The proposed model lists 'n' places of interest from each category in proportion to the travel category score generated by the model. © 2018 IEEE.","personalization; recommender systems; social media analysis; twitter data","Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Recommender systems; Social networking (online); Surveys; Customized services; Historical buildings; Identification techniques; Machine learning classification; Personalizations; Prediction accuracy; Social media analysis; Twitter datum; Big data","","","","","","","Adomavicius G., Tuzhilin A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17, 6, pp. 734-749, (2005); Bobadilla J., Ortega F., Hernando A., Gutirrez A., Recommender systems survey, Knowledge-Based Systems, 46, pp. 109-132, (2013); Burke R., Hybrid Recommender Systems: Survey and Experiments, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 12, 4, pp. 331-370, (2002); Celdrn A.H., Prez M.G., Garca Clemente F.J., Prez G.M., Design of a recommender system based on users' behavior and collaborative location and tracking, Journal of Computational Science, 12, pp. 83-94, (2016); Global Social Media Research Summary 2018, Smart Insights, (2018); Herlocker J.L., Konstan J.A., Riedl J., Explaining Collaborative Filtering Recommendations, Proceedings of the 2000 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, pp. 241-250, (2000); Martinkus P., Madiraju P., Personalizing Places of Interest Using Social Media Analysis, (2015); Ricci F., Rokach L., Shapira B., Kantor P.B., Recommender Systems Handbook, (2011); Van Canneyt S., Van Laere O., Schockaert S., Dhoedt B., Using Social Media to Find Places of Interest: A Case Study, Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Crowdsourced and Volunteered Geographic Information, pp. 2-8, (2012); Zhou T., Kuscsik Z., Liu J.-G., Medo M., Wakeling J.R., Zhang Y.-C., Solving the apparent diversity-accuracy dilemma of recommender systems, PNAS, 107, 10, pp. 4511-4515, (2010)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; IEEE Computer Society","7th IEEE International Congress on Big Data, BigData Congress 2018","2 July 2018 through 7 July 2018","San Francisco","139612","","978-153867232-7","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Information on travel destinations and their associated resources, such as hotels, restaurants, museums or events, etc., is commonly sought by potential tourists and can be useful to plan their trip. However, the list of possibilities offered by web search engines or specialised tourist sites can be overwhelming. Evaluating this long list of options is very complex and time consuming for tourists to choose the best destination suits to their needs. Computer techniques have been developed to facilitate this search as well as the extraction of relevant information. In this article, we will focus on the recommendation systems by providing a detailed and up-to-date review of the most commonly used profiling techniques and recommendation approaches in the field of tourism, with specific emphasis on content-based and collaborative approaches.

They help users by predicting their interests in many domains like e-government, social networks, e-commerce and entertainment. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most promising technique used in recommender systems to give suggestions based on liked-mind users’ preferences. Despite the widespread use of CF in providing personalized recommendation, this technique has problems including cold start, data sparsity and gray sheep. Eventually, these problems lead to the deterioration of the efficiency of CF. Most existing recommendation methods have been proposed to overcome the problems of CF. However, they fail to suggest the top-n recommendations based on the sequencing of the users’ priorities. In this research, to overcome the shortcomings of CF and current recommendation methods in ranking preference dataset, we have used a new graph-based structure to model the users’ priorities and capture the association between users and items. Users’ profiles are created based on their past and current interest. This is done because their interest can change with time. Our proposed algorithm keeps the preferred items of active user at the beginning of the recommendation list. This means these items come under top-n recommendations, which results in satisfaction among users. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm archives the significant improvement in comparison with CF and other proposed recommendation methods in terms of recall, precision, f-measure and MAP metrics using two benchmark datasets including MovieLens and Superstore. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative filtering;

There is already a significant amount of relevant works in the bibliography, which has been primarily empowered by large-scale research and development projects. Various approaches have been adopted from the recommender systems technology, including collaborative filtering, content-based, knowledge-based and hybrid systems. In most of these approaches that focused on museum guidance, which is the focus of this paper, the museum has been assumed to be a form of a gallery and the visitor was treated primarily as a user in seek on engagement and enjoyment. The free museum roaming was the main form of visit that has been considered and targeted, while the educational factors and storytelling aspects have been markedly overlooked. In this paper a new framework for the user satisfaction modelling is being presented that quantifies user satisfaction based on a weighted combination of various probabilistic factors that are being estimated during a museum visit. The goal is to provide a model of user satisfaction that can be used for museum recommenders that could guide either free-roaming visits or guided-tour scenarios for visitors of various motivations and backgrounds. © 2019, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Cultural heritage; Machine learning; Museum guide; Recommendation; Recommender system; User modelling; User satisfaction","Artificial intelligence; Collaborative filtering; Hybrid systems; Knowledge based systems; Learning systems; Recommender systems; Cultural heritages; Museum guide; Recommendation; User Modelling; User satisfaction; Museums","","","","","European Commission, EC; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER;AN:ERDF","Acknowledgement.

One timeconsuming task that remains manual is configuring the LSPD flow parameters, which significantly impacts design results. To reduce the parameter-tuning effort, we propose an LSPD parameter recommender system that involves learning a collaborative prediction model through tensor decomposition and regression. Using a model trained with archived data from multiple state-of-the-art 14nm processors, we reduce the exploration cost while achieving comparable design quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate the transfer-learning properties of our approach by showing that this model can be successfully applied for 7nm designs. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","","Computer aided design; Integrated circuit design; Logic design; Logic Synthesis; Collaborative predictions; Complex design tasks; Flow parameters; High performance processors; Parameter-tuning; Tensor decomposition; Time-consuming tasks; Transfer learning; Recommender systems","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1527821); Norsk Sykepleierforbund, NSF, (A#: 1527821)","Funding text 1: This work is partially supported by the NSF (A#: 1527821).; Funding text 2: 7 CONCLUSION We present a recommender system of LSPD parameters, with the goal of reducing the high costs in VLSI design, especially for server-class high-performance processors. The proposed system learns the QoR prediction model using the LSPD archive and then uses it to generate scenario recommendations. In many cases, recommended scenarios are unique and have never been previously observed. Experimental results show that our approach can reduce the computational cost of DSE, and assist designers to improve the QoR by recommending scenarios to combine with their own configurations.

However, for archives and special collections, such automated assistance has been rare. This is partly due to the complexity of descriptions (finding Aids describing whole collections) and partly due to the complexity of the collections themselves (what is this collection about and how is it related to another collection?). The American Philosophical Society Library is using circulation data collected through the collection-management software package, Aeon, to automate recommendations. In our system, which we’re calling PAL (People Also Liked), recommendations are offered in two ways: based on interests (“You’re interested in X, other people interested in X looked at these collections”) and on specific requests (“You’ve looked at Y, other people who looked at Y also looked that these collections”). This article will discuss the development of PAL and plans for the system. We will also discuss ongoing concerns and issues, how patron privacy is protected, and the possibility of generalizing beyond any specific software solution. © 2018 American Library Association.All right reserved.","","article; human; information center; privacy; publication; software","","","","","","","Subject guides and bibliographies, American Philosophical Society, (2018); Exhibitions, American Philosophical Society, (2018); Galleries, American Philosophical Society, (2018); Atlas Systems, (2018); Monnich M., Spiering M., Adding value to the library catalog by implementing a recommendation system, D-Lib Magazine, 14, 5-6, (2008); Reidsma M., Algorithmic bias in library discovery systems, Matthew Reidsma, (2016); American philoso phical society/pal, American Philosophical Society, (2017); William parker foulke papers, 1840–1865, American Philosophical Society, (2018); Recommendation system to suggest items to researchers based on users with the same research topic, Atlas Systems, (2018)","","","American Library Association","","","","","","07309295","","","","English","Inf.

With the advent of the social web, the cultural heritage area is affected by the problem of information overload. Indeed, a large number of available resources have emerged coming from the social information systems (SocIS). Therefore, visitors are swamped with enormous choices in their visited cities. SocIS platforms use the features of collaborative tagging, named folksonomy, to commonly contribute to the management of the shared resources. However, collaborative tagging uses uncontrolled vocabulary which semantically weakens the description of resources, consequently decreases their classification, clustering, thereby their recommendation. Therefore, the shared resources have to be pertinently described to ameliorate their recommendations. In this paper, we aim to enhance the cultural heritage visits by suggesting semantically related places that are most likely to interest a visitor. Our proposed approach represents a semantic graph-based recommender system of cultural heritage places through two steps; (1) constructing an emergent semantic description that semantically augments the place and (2) effectively modeling the emerging graphs representing the semantic relatedness of similar cultural heritage places and their related tags. The experimental evaluation shows relevant results attesting the efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2021, IICM.

It represents one of the scenarios where new technologies can provide more interesting contributions. In particular, adaptive systems and related services may increase the promotion of cultural heritage. In fact, tourists can use several services able to filter the huge amount of data present on the network in order to only provide relevant information. The aim of this paper is to introduce a chatbot based on a Context-Aware System. This chatbot recommends contents and services according to tourist profiles and context. For testing the proposed architecture, a prototype was developed in order to support tourists during a visit to some cultural sites in Campania: Paestum, Pompeii and Herculaneum. The first experimental results are encouraging and show the potential of the proposed approach. © 2019 IEEE.","Chatbot; Context-Aware Computing; Information Retrieval; Recommender Systems","Campania; Chatbot; Context-Aware; Context-aware systems; Cultural heritages; Paestum; Proposed architectures; Tourist destinations","","","","","","","Ashton K., That 'internet of things' thing, RFID J., 22, 7, pp. 97-114, (2009); Capriglione D., Carratu M., Ferro M., Pietrosanto A., Sommella P., Estimating the Outdoor PM10 Concentration Through Wireless Sensor Network for Smart Metering, pp. 399-404, (2019); Colace F., Santaniello D., Casillo M., Clarizia F., BeCAMS: A behaviour context aware monitoring system, 2017 IEEE International Workshop on Measurement and Networking, M and N 2017-Proceedings, (2017); Clarizia F., Colace F., De Santo M., Lombardi M., Pascale F., Santaniello D., Tuker A., A multilevel graph approach for rainfall forecasting: A preliminary study case on London area, Concurr.

This paper tries to address this issue, by proposing a personalized and content adaptive cultural heritage path recommendation system, where location is modeled using mean-shift clustering trained with actual user movement patters. Additionally, topic modeling is incorporated to formalize the implicit cultural heritage content, while first order Markov models address the movement as a temporal transition aspect of the problem. The overall architecture is applied on data collected from actual visits to the archaeological sites of Gournia and Çatalhöyük and extensive analysis on visitor movement patterns follows, especially in comparison to the curated paths in the aforementioned sites. Finally, the offline evaluation results of the proposed recommendation scheme are encouraging, validating its efficiency and setting a positive paradigm for cultural heritage route recommendations. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Computer assisted archaeology; Cultural heritage path recommendation; Digital cultural heritage; Personalized Cultural User eXperience; Route recommendation; User modeling","Markov processes; Recommender systems; Computer assisted; Cultural heritages; Digital cultural heritages; Route recommendation; User experience; User Modeling; Architecture","","","","","Ephorate of Antiquities at Lasithi; Greek Ministry of Culture","We would like to thank Prof. Ian Hodder, director of the Çatalhöyük Research Project, as well as the Ephorate of Antiquities at Lasithi, Greek Ministry of Culture, for the permission to conduct the visitor survey at the archaeological sites of Çatalhöyük and Gournia respectively.","Abel F., Gao Q., Houben G.J., Tao K., Analyzing user modeling on twitter for personalized news recommendations, International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization, pp. 1-12, (2011); Alexandridis G., Siolas G., Stafylopatis A., Enhancing social collaborative filtering through the application of non-negative matrix factorization and exponential random graph models, Data Min.

The digital support of the tourist experience is typically based on Tourist Recommender Systems (TRS). Widely spread TRSs typically recommend the visit of a set of Point of Interests (POIs). Unfortunately, some of these have also proved inappropriate because they do not consider in detail the indoor visit of a POI, such as a museum, which may contain several artworks and may have limited or regulated access. In this paper, we present our ongoing work on a Context-Aware Touristic Recommender System (CATReS). It provides an outdoor recommendation to select POIs suitable for a visit, as well as an indoor recommendation to select the artwork to visit. The overall recommendations are based on contextual information coming from both visitors’ profile and the POIs’ contextual information (e.g., the waiting time to access the museum, the average time to visit it). Our tour recommendation system is available and is being experimented at the Uffizi Galleries (Florence, Italy). Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

Unlike other domains, such as movies, where the user selects only one movie to watch, in the museum domain it is necessary to recommend a sequence of items to consume, in which the order and relationships among them might affect the recommendation. Furthermore, curators determine a place for each artwork in the museum, generating a distribution over the museum's rooms that imposes constraints about the way visitors walk through it. However, nowadays it is also possible to access to their digital collection, gaining independence from the physical distribution, allowing any visitor to be his/her own curator. Because of that, in this article we analyze and discuss different approaches to exploit the particularities of this domain. Specifically, we focus on one aspects, namely: item modeling. First, we summarize different approaches to represent and extract features from artworks that could be relevant for the recommendation task. Finally, we propose a novel approach to model artworks that could be useful in the recommendation task. © 2019 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Ontology; Recommeder System","Deep learning; Knowledge engineering; Ontology; Digital collections; Hybrid approach; Recommeder System; Museums","","","","","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET, (11220150100030CO); Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica, ANPCyT, (2016-2973)","Funding text 1: This work has been partially supported by CONICET PIP Project No. 11220150100030CO and by ANPCyT Project No. 2016-2973.; Funding text 2: ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work has been partially supported by CONICET PIP Project No. 11220150100030CO and by ANPCyT Project No. 2016-2973.","Aumont J., The Image, (1997); Fernandez S., Juan E.S., Juan M.T.-M., Textual energy of associative memories: Performant applications of enertex algorithm in text summarization and topic segmentation, Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 861-871, (2007); Gatti I., Schiaffino S., Pace A.D., Un enfoque de recomendacion multi-dominio basado en embeddings y redes semanticas, XXIV Congreso Argentino de Ciencias de la Computacion, (2018); Gatys L.A., Ecker A.S., Bethge M., A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style; Gombrich E.H., The Story of Art, (1995); Goodfellow I., Bengio Y., Courville A., Deep Learning, (2016); Karayev S., Et al., Recognizing Image Style; Knees P., Schedl M., A Survey of Music Similarity and Recommendation from Music Context Data, ACM Trans.

Nowadays users have access to millions of songs available online. Selecting favorite music among these large archives is one of the biggest problem. Every user has his own taste of music selection. Selecting music depends on the surroundings and the mood of the user. New users and new items emerge every day, and the system has to react to them promptly. The problem of personalized music recommendation that takes different kinds of auxiliary information into consideration is resource constraint due to large amount of data involvement but these models provide much accurate results so more of these are being used for commercial purpose. The main aim of the recommendation system is to recommend songs such that it is closed to the user's choice. As a comparative study, we will be analyzing the Graph-based Novelty Research On The Music Recommendation, Music Recommendation System Based on the Continuous Combination of Contextual Information, Smart-DJ: Context-aware Personalizing for Music Recommendation on Smart phones. These models are outlined to assist the users to find out the new music that is personalized.

The collaborative web services (folksonomies) enable users to assign their freely chosen keywords (tags) to describe web resources. The advent of folksonomy has evolved the role of web users from consumers to contributors of information. Thus, users attribute their descriptive tags to annotate, organize and classify web resources of interests. Folksonomy became popular with the emergence of collaborative tagging. It offers a practical classification of web resources via the attributed tags. Nonetheless, the freely chosen tags weaken the semantic description of web resources. Folksonomy can give rise to a poor classification system based on ambiguous and inconsistent tags. Therefore, it is essential to pertinently describe the semantic of web resources to enhance their classification, findability and discoverability. The proposed approach represents a combined semantic enrichment strategy that explores collaborative tagging towards describing each web resource using different types of descriptive metadata, namely relevant folksonomy tags, content-based main keywords and matching ontology terms. The experimental evaluation has shown relevant results attesting the efficiency of our proposal. The alignment of social tagging with the ontology will not only enhances the classification of web resources but also constructs their semantic clustering. This emergent semantic will establish new challenges to improve the context-aware recommender systems of web resources in different real-world applications (healthcare, social education and cultural heritage). © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Emergent semantic; Folksonomy; Ontology; Recommender system; Semantic web; Web resource","Ontology; Recommender systems; User interfaces; Web services; Websites; Classification system; Collaborative tagging; Collaborative Web services; Context-aware recommender systems; Experimental evaluation; Folksonomies; Semantic descriptions; Web resources; Semantic Web","","","","","","","Baker M., Every Page is Page One, (2013); Kang J.-H., Lerman K., Leveraging user diversity to harvest knowledge on the social web, Proceedings of the IEEE Third International Conference on Social Computing, (2011); Lau Raymond Y.K., Leon Zhao J., Wenping Z., Yi C., Ngai Eric W.T., Learning contect-sensitive domain ontologies from folksonomies: a cognitively motivated method, Inf J Comput, 27, pp. 561-578, (2015); Daglas S., Kakali C., Kakavoulis D., Koumaki M., Papatheodorou C., A methodology for folksonomy evaluation, Theory and practice of digital libraries.

Indeed when people decide to visit museums or archaeological sites, they usually would like to organize and schedule their time in order to fulfill some requirements and to match, as far as possible, their preferences and needs. In this work, we propose a novel methodology integrating recommendation facilities with agent-based planning techniques in order to implement a planner of routes within cultural sites as museums. In particular, the introduced methodology exploits from one hand a user-centered recommendation strategy to suggest the most suitable cultural items with respect to user's preferences and, from the other one, it leverages multi-agents planning methods to generate the related routes consisting of the sequence of steps necessary to reach precise cultural goals depending on the context, by means of a state space exploration. We present a case of study for the proposed methodology and we describe some experimental results on system efficiency. © 2020","Formal planning; Multi-agent systems; Recommender systems","Intelligent agents; Intelligent systems; Museums; Recommender systems; Space research; Agent-based approach; Archaeological site; Cultural heritages; Planning techniques; Recommendation strategies; State space exploration; System efficiency; User's preferences; Multi agent systems","","","","","","","Ahmed I., Ahmad A., Piccialli F., Sangaiah A., Jeon G., A robust features-based person tracker for overhead views in industrial environment, IEEE Internet Things J, 5, 3, pp. 1598-1605; Albanese M., Chianese A., d'Acierno A., Moscato V., Picariello A., A multimedia recommender integrating object features and user behavior, Multimed.

Most of them, however, recommend similar itineraries, usually even in the same overcrowded areas. In this article, we present the concept of an integrated framework for cultural tourism with different characteristics. Such a framework can propose alternative customized itineraries to favor cultural and social inclusion of visitors with local residents, for example, in urban suburbs or agricultural and industrial regions. Therefore, the system has to provide user interfaces to enable organizations, local enterprises, and visitors to analyze and exploit rich open data sources. In this way, local institutions could better plan and handle cultural tourism and public resources. Small businesses could cost-effectively promote their services. Visitors could receive personalized routes with knowledge related to local communities, cultures, traditions, and others. © 2021  Copyright © 2021 for this paper by its authors.","Cultural heritage; Open data; Point of interest; Recommender systems","Agricultural robots; Open Data; Recommender systems; Smartphones; Tourism; Data-sources; Integrated frameworks; Local community; Local institutions; Local residents; Public resources; Small business; Social inclusion; User interfaces","","","","","","","Ursache M., Tourism-significant driver shaping a destinations heritage, Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 188, pp. 130-137, (2015); Richards G., Cultural tourism: A review of recent research and trends, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 36, (2018); Vaccaro L., Sansonetti G., Micarelli A., An empirical review of automated machine learning, Computers, 10, (2021); Sansonetti G., Gasparetti F., D'Aniello G., Micarelli A., Unreliable users detection in social media: Deep learning techniques for automatic detection, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 213154-213167, (2020); D'Aniello G., Gaeta M., Orciuoli F., Sansonetti G., Sorgente F., Knowledge-based smart city service system, Electronics (Switzerland), 9, pp. 1-22, (2020); D'Agostino D., Gasparetti F., Micarelli A., Sansonetti G., A social context-aware recommender of itineraries between relevant points of interest, HCI International 2016-Posters' Extended Abstracts, 618, pp. 354-359, (2016); Kaminskas M., Bridge D., Diversity, serendipity, novelty, and coverage: A survey and empirical analysis of beyond-accuracy objectives in recommender systems, ACM Trans.

However, questions arise like which exhibition/museum could I visit? How to tour it and get the best experience? These questions are not easy to answer, because they do not represent tasks straightforward. Considering that the experiences of visiting a museum are now available in social networks, in which users describe, rate, and disseminate a work of art/exhibition of a museum, this information can be mined to generate tour recommendations in museums. Such recommendations could be improved by combining and applying data mining obtained from Internet of Things sensors installed in museums. In this paper, a hybrid approach to make recommendations for museum visits is proposed. It includes an Internet of Things architecture of beacons, incorporating some technologies based on semantic analysis, data mining, and machine learning. This approach integrates and combines data sources for generating and recommending indoor and outdoor itineraries for museums, which are visualized with augmented reality. The itinerary is built, taking into consideration opinions and assessments from social networks, the semantic classification of museums, and cultural activities, as well as data measured by beacon sensors in museum exhibitions. The result is a customized tour with augmented reality that contains a set of recommendations of how to visit a set of museums and obtain a better experience of the visit. A prototype of mobile application is available in the Google Play, called the “Historic Center,” with almost 500 downloads and an acceptable evaluation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Augmented reality; Internet of things; Mobile devices; Semantic classification; Tour recommendations","Augmented reality; Data mining; Internet of things; Mobile computing; Semantic Web; Semantics; Social networking (online); User experience; Hybrid approach; Internet of things architectures; Mining techniques; Mobile applications; Semantic analysis; Semantic classification; Social sensors; Tour recommendations; Exhibitions","","","","","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog?a; Secretar?a de Investigaci?n y Posgrado; Secretaría de Investigación y Posgrado, (20171086, 20171192, 20171463, 20171918); Instituto Politécnico Nacional, IPN; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT, (1051)","Funding text 1: This work was partially sponsored by the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN), the Secretaría de Investigación y Posgrado (SIP) under Grants 20171918, 20171086, 20171463, and 20171192, as well as the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT) with the grant 1051.

Modern e-learning environments exploit technologies ca-pable of designing increasingly specific learning paths. This approach could be interesting in the field of Cultural Heritage. In this scenario, the introduction of a framework able to automatically design tailored learning paths to be used during the visit of archaeological sites could be engaging. The proposed framework aims to exploit contextual graph approaches, such as Ontology and Context Dimension Tree and probabilistic graph approaches such as Bayesian Networks for inferring adapted and contextual learning paths. In particular, it supports learners during their visits in real scenarios as archaeological parks or museums. This engine selects contents and services according to the learner’s profile and the context. The main advantage of the proposed system is to design and suggest tailored learning paths to be used on-site in order to improve the training process. Besides, the proposed approach can exploit context modelling and predictive techniques, which can improve the ability to recommend learning paths. A prototype has been developed and tested in real scenarios as the archaeological parks of Paestum, Herculaneum and Pompeii. In particular, several aspects have been tested, such as performance, usability and effectiveness, and more specific tests have been performed measuring the accuracy in learning path recommendations with promising results. © 2020, Innovative Information Science and Technology Research Group.

Recommendation systems in e-commerce are built on knowledge about the users' previous purchasing history; recommendation systems for museums, on the other hand, do not have an equivalent data source available. Recent solutions have incorporated advanced technologies such as algorithms that rely on social filtering, which builds recommendations from the nearest identified similar user. Our paper proposes a different approach, and involves providing dynamic recommendations that deploy social filtering as well as content-based filtering using term frequency-inverse document frequency. The main challenge is to overcome a cold start, whereby no information is available on new users entering the system, and thus there is no strong background information for generating the recommendation. In these cases, our solution deploys statistical methods to create a recommendation, which can then be used to gather data for future iterations. We are currently running a pilot test at Chao Samphraya national museum and have received positive feedback to date on the implementation. © The Korea Institute of Information and Communication Engineering.","Mobile application; Museum guide; Recommendation system","","","","","","Thailand Science Research and Innovation; Thailand Science Research and Innovation, TSRI","This research was supported by Thailand Science Research and Innovation under the project Transferring Museum Guide Technology for Community-Based Tourism Phase II.","Aggarwal C.C., An introduction to recommender system, Recommender Systems, pp. 1-28, (2016); Biuk-Aghai R.P., Fong S., Si Y., Design of a recommender system for mobile tourism multimedia selection, 2nd International Conference on Internet Multimedia Services Architecture and Applications, pp. 1-6, (2008); Luh D., Yang T., Museum recommendation system based on lifestyles, 9th International Conference on Computer-Aided Industrial Design and Conceptual Design, pp. 884-889, (2008); Roes I., Stash N., Wang Y., Aroyo L., A personalized walk through the museum, The CHIP Interactive Tour guide, in CHIP 2009 Extended Abstract on Human Factor in Computing System, pp. 3317-3322, (2009); Lykourentzoy I., Claude X., Naudet Y., Improving museum visitors; quality of experience through intelligent recommendations: A visiting style-based approach, Conference: Museums as intelligent environments (MasIE2013)-Workshop co-located with the 9th International Conference on Intelligent Environments, pp. 507-518, (2013); Fournier R., Viennet E., Sean S., Soulie F.F., Benaiche M., AMMICO: Social recommendation for museums, Proceeding of Digital Intelligence, (2014); Keller I., Viennet E., Recommender systems for museums: Evaluation on a real dataset, Fifth International Conference on Advances in Information Mining and Management, pp. 65-71, (2015); Kuflik T., Minkov E., Kahanov K., Graph-based recommendation in the Museum, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, vol. 1278, Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Decision Making and Recommender Systems, pp. 46-48, (2014); Pavlidis G., Towards a novel user satisfaction modelling for museum visit recommender systems, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 904, pp. 60-75, (2018); Rodriguez-Hernandez M.C., Ilarri S., Hermoso R., Lado R.T., Towards trajectory-based recommendations in museums: Evaluation of strategies using mixed synthetic and real data, The 8th international conference on Emerging Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks, pp. 234-239, (2017); Rajaonaruvo L., Fonteles A., Sallberry C., Bessagnet M., Roose P., Etcheverrt P., Marquesazaa C., Lacayrelle A.L.P., Cayere C., Coudert Q., Recommendation of heterogeneous cultural heritage objects for promotion of tourism, International Journal of Geo-information, 8, 5, pp. 230-255, (2019); Kovavisaruch L., Sanpechuda T., Chinda K., Wongsatho T., Wisadsud S., Chaiwongyen A., Recommendation system with limited time for visiting museum, International Conference on Culture Technology, pp. 199-204, (2019); Rajaraman A., Ullman J.D., Data mining"" (PDF), Mining of Massive Datasets, pp. 1-17; Wongsatho T., Kovavisaruch L., Sanpechuda T., Chinda K., Wisadsud S., Chaiwongyen A., The development of museums network guide system by using QR code on smart phone, WMS Journal of Management, 4, 1, pp. 12-22, (2016)","Thailand","","Korea Institute of Information and Communication Engineering","","","","","","22348255","","","","English","J.

The immediate consequence is the loss of time for the user due to the difficulty of accessing relevant information, and therefore a questioning of the usefulness of the services offered. Recommender system (RS) aims to help potential users by recommending the most suitable offers according to their profiles and preferences, RSs based on collaborative filtering, or those based on content or even hybrid filtering have shown interesting results to be explored for the resolution of the problems encountered. But some limits remain unresolved which are mainly related to the ability of these techniques to build a robust and complete system capable of forming a complete idea of the user profile and then recommend them the most suitable offers.

It used to be a difficult task to make the personalized recommended list for museum-goer. However, with the current technology, research can provide the list for visitors via technology such as mobile applications. We have proposed a recommendation system based on social filtering and statistical methods in the previous paper. This paper applies the F1-score to evaluate our recommendation methods on the actual visitor loggers from Chao sampradaya national museum. We compare the social filtering method with the statistical method and benchmark with the random recommendation. In comparison, the statistical method gives the same result as social filtering when the time is limited. The longer time the visitor spends in the museum, the better result from the social filtering. However, in terms of calculation complexity, the statistical method outperforms social filtering.  © 2021 IEEE.","evaluation; museum recommendation","Recommender systems; Statistics; Current technology; Evaluation; F1 scores; Mobile applications; Museum recommendation; Recommendation methods; Recommended systems; Social filtering; Technology research; Via technologies; Museums","","","","","","","Fournier R., Viennet E., Sean S., Soulie F.F., Benaiche M., Ammico: Social recommendation for museums, Proceeding of Digital Intelligence, (2014); Roes I., Stash N., Wang Y., Aroyo L., A personalized walk through the museum, CHIP 2009 Extended Abstract on Human Factor in Computing System, pp. 3317-3322, (2009); Alletto S., Cucchiara R., Fiore G.D., Et al., An indoor location-awaresystem for an IoT-based smart museum, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 3, 2, (2016); Spachos P., Konstantinos N., BLE beacons for indoor positioning at an interactive IoT-based smart museum, IEEE Systems Journal, 14, 3, (2020); Aggarwal C.C., An Introduction to A Recommender System, pp. 1-28; Kuflik T., Minkov E., Kahanov K., Graph-based recommendation in the Museum, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 1278, pp. 46-48, (2014); Deladiennee L., Naudet Y., A graph-based semantic recommender system for a reflective and personalized museum visit: Extended abstract, 12th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation and Personalization, (2017); Luh D., Yang T., Museum recommendation system based on lifestyles,  International Conference on Computer-Aided Industrial Design and Conceptual Design, pp. 884-889, (2008); Pavlidis G., Apollo - A hybrid recommender for museums and cultural tourism, International Conference on Intelligent Systems, (2018); Lykourentzou I., Claude X., Naudet Y., Et al., Improving Museum visitors; quality of experience through intelligent recommendations: A visiting style-based approach, 9th International Conference on Intelligent Environments, pp. 507-518, (2013); Kovavisaruch L., Sanpechuda T., Chinda K., Et al., Incorporating time constraints into a recommender system for museum visitors, J.

Typically, this issue is regarded as a scalability problem and has been mainly addressed with distributed algorithms able to train on massive amounts of data in short time windows. However, data is inevitably adding up at high speeds. Eventually one needs to discard or archive some of it. Moreover, the dynamic nature of data in user modeling and recommender systems, such as change of user preferences, and the continuous introduction of new users and items make it increasingly difcult to maintain up-to-date, accurate recommendation models. The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in incremental and adaptive approaches to stream-based user modeling, recommendation and personalization, including algorithms, evaluation issues, incremental content and context mining, privacy and transparency, temporal recommendation or software frameworks for continuous learning. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Data streams; Online learning; Recommender systems","Online systems; Recommender systems; Adaptive approach; Continuous learning; Data stream; Online learning; Online recommender systems; Scalability problems; Short time windows; Software frameworks; Learning systems","","","","","","","Jorge A., Vinagre J., Matuszyk P., Spiliopoulou M., Orsum chairs' Welcome & Organization, Companion of the the Web Conference 2018 on the Web Conference 2018, WWW 2018, pp. 1365-1366, (2018)","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","13th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, RecSys 2019","16 September 2019 through 20 September 2019","Copenhagen","151935","","978-145036243-6","","","English","RecSys - ACM Conf.

Such smart environments aim to provide an improved, personalized experience based on the trail of user interactions with smart devices, but how does recommendation in smart environments differ from the usual online recommender systems? And can we exploit similarities to truly blend behavior in both realms to address the fundamental cold-start problem? In this article, we experiment with behavioral user models based on interactions with smart devices in a museum, and investigate the personalized recommendation of what to see after visiting an initial set of Point of Interests (POIs), a key problem in personalizing museum visits or tour guides, and focus on a critical one-shot POI recommendation task—where to go next? We have logged users' onsite physical information interactions during visits in an IoT-augmented museum exhibition at scale. Furthermore, we have collected an even larger set of search logs of the online museum collection. Users in both sets are unconnected, for privacy reasons we do not have shared IDs. We study the similarities between users' online digital and onsite physical information interaction behaviors, and build new behavioral user models based on the information interaction behaviors in (i) the physical exhibition space, (ii) the online collection, or (iii) both. Specifically, we propose a deep neural multilayer perceptron (MLP) based on explicitly given users' contextual information, and set-based extracted features using users' physical information interaction behaviors and similar users' digital information interaction behaviors. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed behavioral user modeling approach, using both physical and online user information interaction behaviors, improves the onsite POI recommendation baselines' performances on all evaluation metrics. Our proposed MLP approach achieves 83% precision at rank 1 on the critical one-shot POI recommendation problem, realizing the high accuracy needed for fruitful deployment in practical situations. Furthermore, the MLP model is less sensitive to amount of real-world interactions in terms of the seen POIs set-size, by backing of to the online data, hence helps address the cold start problem in recommendation. Our general conclusion is that it is possible to fruitfully combine information interactions in the online and physical world for effective recommendation in smart environments. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The emergence of big data analytics, recommendation systems and personalization techniques have created a smart research field, augmenting cultural heritage visitor’s experience. In this work, a novel, hybrid recommender system for cultural places is proposed, that combines user preference with cultural tourist typologies. Starting with the McKercher typology as a user classification research base, which extracts five categories of heritage tourists out of two variables (cultural centrality and depth of user experience) and using a questionnaire, an enriched cultural tourist typology is developed, where three additional variables governing cultural visitor types are also proposed (frequency of visits, visiting knowledge and duration of the visit). The extracted categories per user are fused in a robust collaborative filtering, matrix factorization-based recommendation algorithm as extra user features. The obtained results on reference data collected from eight cities exhibit an improvement in system performance, thereby indicating the robustness of the presented approach. © 2020 by the authors.

To address such issues, we propose improving the data discovery system and using data analytics methods to comprehend what specific users might be interested in based on their physiological state, search patterns, and past data usage history. This work's primary goal is to prune the complexity, increase the visibility of popular data products, and direct users toward the data that best meet their needs. The proposed algorithm constructs a user profile based on the user's explicit or implicit interactions with the system, such as items they are currently looking at on-site and the key metadata mappings related to the data set. The pattern is then used to build a training data set, which will help find relevant data to recommend to the user. © 2020 IEEE.","clustering; collaborative filtering; content-based filtering; data discovery; data recommended system","Big data; Data Analytics; Predictive analytics; Implicit interaction; Metadata mappings; Oak ridge National Laboratory; Physiological state; Scientific data; Search patterns; Training data sets; US Department of Energy; Search engines","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Biological and Environmental Research, BER, (DE-AC05-00OR22725)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility, a US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science user facility managed by the Office of Biological and Environmental Research.

Most of the daily activities, such as communicating with friends, reading news or dating is usually done using social networks. However, there are activities for which social networks do not yet provide adequate support. This paper focuses on event management and introduces 'Hikester'. The main objective of this service is to provide users with the possibility to create any event they desire and to invite other users. 'Hikester' supports the creation and management of events like attendance of football matches, quest rooms, shared train rides or visit of museums in foreign countries.

The target of recommendation system is to predict user preferences based on their previous activities, and associating users of similar behavior. Of the two main approaches, Content Based (CB) and Collaborative Filtering (CF), CF is increasingly popular because there is no need of domain knowledge and it scales well for large datasets. CF uses archives, like user-item purchase data or user-movie review data, which are large and sparse. Traditional approaches using matrix factorization like singular valued decomposition (SVD), is inefficient, for very a large review data. It is more efficient to cluster item-vectors, where elements of an item-vector are entries from users. As the dimension of an item-vector is large and elements are sparse, conventional clustering algorithms fails. We created item-item adjacency matrix, where the elements are similarity between item-vectors. There are various clustering algorithms that work directly on the adjacency matrix. We used spectral clustering, K-means++, Agglomerative Clustering. Considering item-vectors as nodes and adjacency matrix elements as link weights, we performed graph-clustering using Louvain Algorithm, to discover groups. We used synthetic data, added different levels of noise and run different algorithms to compare their accuracies to restore the original data from the noisy one. Louvain algorithm and Spectral clustering could achieve the highest accuracies.  © 2020 ACM.","Adjacency Matrix; Cluster-based Collaborative Filtering; Recommender System; Similarity Measure","Collaborative filtering;

Not only it helps in efficient search, archiving and classification of movies, but is also instrumental in content censorship and recommendation systems. Extracting key information from a movie and summarizing it in a few tags which best describe the movie presents a dedicated challenge and requires an intelligent approach to automatically analyze the movie. In this paper, we formulate movies tags extraction problem as a machine learning classification problem and train a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) on a carefully constructed tag vocabulary. Our proposed technique first extracts key frames from a movie and applies the trained classifier on the key frames. The predictions from the classifier are assigned scores and are filtered based on their relative strengths to generate a compact set of most relevant key tags. We performed a rigorous subjective evaluation of our proposed technique for a wide variety of movies with different experiments. The evaluation results presented in this paper demonstrate that our proposed approach can efficiently extract the key tags of a movie with a good accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.","","Deep learning; Extraction;

So far, many recommender systems neglect this kind of information and thus cannot provide situationspecific recommendations. Situation-Aware recommender systems adapt to changes in the user's environment and therefore are able to offer recommendations that are more appropriate for the current situation. In this paper, we present a software architecture that enables situation awareness for arbitrary recommendation techniques. The proposed system considers both (semi-)static user profiles and volatile situational knowledge to obtain meaningful recommendations. Furthermore, the implementation of the architecture in a museum of natural history is presented, which uses Complex Event Processing to achieve situation awareness. ©2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

However, to be effectively used, we have several problems to be addressed: user preferences are not expressed as rating and recommendation systems must provide for new users efficient and simple preferences elicitation processes that do not require much effort and time. In this work, we present and evaluate 2 state-of-the-art approaches that share the aim not to rely on individual item ratings. The first method uses a clustering algorithm to categorize items and provide recommendations, while the second one is inspired by the matrix factorization approach to select a couples of item groups that users have to evaluate to obtain preference profiles. We evaluate the 2 approaches with both an off-line simulation and a user study with the aim to find the optimal configuration as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of the 2 proposed methods. Results show that the elicitation processes permit to obtain preference profiles in a time substantially less than the baseline method, while the differences in terms of prediction accuracy are minimal.

In this paper, we introduce the objectives of the Tourisitific project, in which we aim to create a recommender system for travel information, supporting a lightweight access through chatbots. In this way, we will support travellers during their visits without burdening them with the installation of dedicated apps. In addition, we will help small and micro touristic operators in building their presence on the web with a familiar and easy to manage interface.","","Interactive computer systems; Recommender systems; Chatbots; Cultural heritages; In-buildings; Key objective; Travel information; Human computer interaction","","","","","","","Ahmed F.F., Hussain S.F., Hameed S., Ali S.M., Semantic web e-portal for tourism, Digital Information and Communication Technology and It's Applications (DICTAP), 2012 Second International Conference on, pp. 154-158, (2012); Brown B., Chalmers M., Bell M., Hall M., MacColl I., Rudman P., Sharing the square: Collaborative leisure in the city streets, ECSCW 2005, pp. 427-447, (2005); Cardoso J., Developing an Owl Ontology for E-tourism.

Visitors of museums are often overwhelmed by the information available in the space they are exploring. Therefore, finding relevant artworks to see in a limited amount of time is a crucial task. In this paper, we present a recommender system for mobile devices that (1) adapts to the users profiles and (2) is sensitive to their context (location, time, expertise, etc.). Our system aims to improve the visitors' experience and help them build their tours on-site according to their preferences and constraints. We first describe our recommendation framework, which consists in a hybrid recommendation system. It combines a semantic approach for the representation of museum domain using ontologies and thesauruses with a semantically-enhanced collaborative filtering method. Then, we present a contextual post filtering that enables the generation of a highly personalized tour based on the physical environment, the location of the visitors and the time they want to spend in the museum. © 2015 IEEE.","context; cultural heritage; Recommender systems; semantic web","Collaborative filtering; Cybernetics; Mobile devices; Museums; Semantic Web; Collaborative filtering methods; context; Context-aware recommendations; Cultural heritages; Hybrid recommendation; Museum collections; Physical environments; Semantic approach; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Kuflik T., Stock O., Zancanaro M., Gorfinkel A., Jbara S., Kats S., Sheidin J., Kashtan N., A visitors guide in an active museum: Presentations, communications, and reflection, J.

With those supports, data scientists can focus their domain problem and design the intelligence module (e.g., prepare the data, select/train/tune the machine learning modules and validate the result). However, there is still a gap between system engineer team and data scientists/engineers team. For system engineers, they don't have any knowledge about the application domain and the propose of the analytic program. For data scientists/engineers, they don't know the configuration of the computation system, file system and database. Some application performance issues are related with system configurations. Data scientist and data engineer do not have information and knowledge about the system properties. In this paper, we propose a configuration layer with the current big data platform (i.e., Hadoop) and build a configuration recommendation system to collect data, pre-process data. Based on the processed data, we use semi-automatic feature engineer to provide features for data engineers and build the performance model with three different machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest, gradient boosting machine and support vector regression). With the same two benchmarks (i.e., wordcount and terasort), our recommended configuration archives remarkable improvement than rule of thumb configuration and better than their improvements. © 2016 IEEE.","big data platform;

This task is often tedious, time consuming and not recorded. COSCHKR captures the core knowledge of these interdisciplinary interactions and logically structures it. COSCHKR is an ontology based knowledge representation that represents the experts’ knowledge explicitly so that it can be reasoned to recommend technology(ies) and their technical solutions. In this paper we discuss how technologies are recommended based on their demands from the cultural heritage application especially focusing on large objects. We also demonstrate how other technologies that are suitable for recording smaller objects are ignored while recommending technologies such as photogrammetry and laser scanning suitable for large objects. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Cultural heritage; Inference; Knowledge representation; Laser scanning; Ontology; Photogrammetry; Recommender system; Spatial technologies; Structured-light 3D scanning","Knowledge representation; Laser applications; Ontology; Photogrammetry; Recommender systems; Scanning; Surface analysis; 3D-scanning; Cultural heritages; Inference; Laser scanning; Spatial technologies; Knowledge based systems","","","","","","","De Luca L., Busayarat C., Stefani C., Veron P., Florenzano M., A semantic-based platform for the digital analysis of architectural heritage, Comput.

Moreover, there typically exists rich complementary information that can be delivered to the visitor about exhibits of interest, but only a fraction of this information can be consumed during the limited time of the visit. Recommender systems may help visitors to cope with this information overload. Ideally, the recommender system of choice should model user preferences, as well as background knowledge about the museum's environment, considering aspects of physical and thematic relevancy. We propose a personalized graph-based recommender framework, representing rating history and background multi-facet information jointly as a relational graph. A random walk measure is applied to rank available complementary multimedia presentations by their relevancy to a visitor's profile, integrating the various dimensions. We report the results of experiments conducted using authentic data collected at the Hecht museum. An evaluation of multiple graph variants, compared with several popular and state-of-the-art recommendation methods, indicates on advantages of the graph-based approach. © 2017 ASIS&T","","Graphic methods;

Quick and easy selecting favorite music among these large archives becomes one of the biggest problems for users. For example, selecting music in a silent forest is different from a crowded street or feelings for listening to music in a morning of a working day is different from an afternoon of a holiday. In this paper, a system has been designed that it collects users' context information such as weather, temperature, geographical position, etc., and according to a weighted combination of them, it recommends an appropriate music that is a user's favorite at the moment. Thus, this system includes a rating method that determines how close are music's context, which have been played before, in the moment's context and recommend the music that has the most closeness. The result of this research shows that recommendations that this system makes in different conditions, is closed to the user's choice. © 2016 IEEE.","Behavior analyze; Contextual information; Music interest's psychology; Music recommendation system","Cellular telephone systems; Mobile phones; World Wide Web; Behavior analyze; Context information; Contextual information; Geographical positions; Intelligent cells; Music interest's psychology; Music players; Music Recommendation System; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Schilit B., Adams N., Want R., Context-Aware computing applications, Mobile Computing Systems and Applications 1994.

The development of academic search engines, digital libraries and archives has led to better information filtering mechanisms that has resulted to improved search results. However, the state-of-the art research-paper recommender systems are still retrieving research articles without explicitly defining the domain of interest of the researchers. Also, a rich set of research output (research objects) and their associated metrics are also not being utilized in the process of searching, querying, retrieving and recommending articles. Consequently, a lot of irrelevant and unrelated information is being presented to the user. Then again, the use of citation counts to rank and recommend research-paper to users is still disputed. Recommendation metrics like citation counts, ratings in collaborative filtering, and keyword analysis' cannot be fully relied on as the only techniques through which similarity between documents can be computed, and this is because recommendations based on such metrics are not accurate and have lots of biasness. Henceforth, altmetric-based techniques and methodologies are expected to give better recommendations of research papers since the circumstances surrounding a research papers are taken into consideration. This paper proposes a research paper recommender system framework that utilizes paper ontology and Altmetric from research papers, to enhance the performance of research paper recommender systems. © 2017 IEEE.","Altmetrics; Citations; Documents; Recommender systems; Research-paper; Semantics; Tags","Collaborative filtering; Digital libraries; Search engines; Semantics; Academic search; Altmetric; Citation; Document; Exponential rates; Filtering mechanism; Research papers; State of the art; System framework; Tag; Recommender systems","","","","","Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is support by the Computer Systems Engineering department of the Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria, South Africa.","Ricci F., Rokach L., Shapira B., Introduction to Recommender Systems Handbook, (2011); Donato H., Traditional and Alternative Metrics: The Full Story of Impact, (2014); Priem J., Piwowar H., Hemminger B., Altmetric in the wild: An exploratory study of impact metrics based on social media, Metrics 2011: Symposium on Informetric and Scientometric Research.

Furthermore, archived news articles tend to be perceived by ordinary users as having rather weak attractiveness and being obsolete or uninteresting. In this paper, we propose the task of finding interesting content from news archives and introduce two simple methods for it.

A cryptographically signed JAR file provides assurance about the authorship of the contents of the archive. We use Signed JAR files as part of a recommendation system. In this system different recommenders will evaluate the same software, and they need to sign the exact same JAR file. The user wants to verify that recommendations (i.e., signatures) received independently from multiple parties, e.g., for a software update, pertain to the exact same software. Related problems occur when users try to sign bundles consisting of files maintained on different servers. The tools in the Java Development Kit do not support this kind of application. We propose techniques to enable the signing of distribute bundles and techniques by which recommenders can sign software independently and such that verifiers are enabled to combine the recommendations. There changes to the Java jarsigner tool would avoid special purpose code which duplicates many of the same capabilities of the existing tools. © 2015 IEEE.","JAR; Recommendation; Security; Signature; Update","Artificial intelligence; Java programming language; Network security; Recommender systems; Java archives; Java development kits; Recommendation; Security; Signature; Software updates; Special-purpose codes; Update; Computer software","","","","","","","Alhamed K., Silaghi M.-C., Hussien I., Stansifer R., Yang Y., Stacking the deck"" attack on software updates: Solution by distributed recommendation of testers, IAT, pp. 293-300, (2013); Buchholz F., The Structure of A Pkzip File, (2015); Godding A., Duong E., Jar Identification and Duplication Detection; Lindner P., Zip: Registration of A New Mime Content-type/subtype, (2015); Standard Data and Time Format Strings, (2015); Packaging Programs in Jar Files, (2015); Jar File Specification; Jarsigner, (2015); Using Predefined Formats, (2015); Shafique M., And Dwight Deugo.

The recommender system provides students with serendipity slider to express desired serendipity and accuracy of recommendations. The recommender uses interface level processing of randomization of recommendations list. The increasing serendipity results in changing score/values of accuracy of recommendations. This was tested by deploying a study material recommender system based on collaborative filtering techniques. The recommender system was used by 60 students in a focus group setting. In conclusion, the research suggests that serendipitous recommendations can be archived using user controlled recommenders in learning environment. © 2018 The Authors.

We envision a large-scale semantic information push system that is able to perform e cient filtering of multiple RDF data streams based on expressive subscriptions that aim both for the structure and content of the stream. To this end, we put forward STIP, a new algorithm that indexes user subscriptions and utilises its index structures to e ciently match them against the stream of RDF events; STIP proves four orders of magnitude faster than its baseline competitor in an experimental evaluation with real-world data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach in the literature to propose the usage of information push -along with an appropriate algorithm- as the technological substrate for a variety of high-level cultural heritage applications such as personalisation and recommender systems. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

The main motivation is that, by considering the current context of the mobile user, more relevant suggestions can be provided. However, further research is required to enable the effective deployment of mobile CARS. In this paper, we study the possibility to implement mobile CARS by using a pure mobile P2P (Peer-to-Peer) approach, where no centralized database or server exists. Instead, the mobile devices of the users propagate rating information in an opportunistic way, when they become neighbors from a communication point of view. We study the problem by considering a specific use case scenario: the recommendation of items to observe in a museum. Besides, we exploit a synthetic generator of datasets for the evaluation of CARS, called DataGenCARS, to build the recommendation scenarios based on real and synthetic data. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Context-aware recommendation systems;

However, the representativeness of data from such surveillance programs is known to be limited by numerous biases. The roe deer (Capreolus capreolus capreolus) is the most abundant ungulate and a major game species all over Europe. Yet, internationally available literature on roe deer pathology is scarce. The aims of this study were (1) to provide an overview of the causes of mortality or morbidity observed in roe deer in Switzerland and to assess potential changes in the disease pattern over time; and (2) to evaluate the value and limitations of a long term dataset originating from general wildlife health surveillance. We compiled 1571 necropsy reports of free ranging roe deer examined at the Centre for Fish and Wildlife Health in Switzerland from 1958 to 2014. Descriptive data analysis was performed considering animal metadata, submitter, pathologist in charge, laboratory methods, morphological diagnoses and etiologies. Recurrent causes of mortality and disease pictures included pneumonia, diarrhea, meningoencephalitis, actinomycosis, blunt trauma, predation, neoplasms and anomalies. By contrast, other diagnoses such as fatal parasitic gastritis, suspected alimentary intoxication and reproductive disorders appeared only in earlier time periods. Diseases potentially relevant for other animals or humans such as caseous lymphadenitis (or pseudotuberculosis), salmonellosis, paratuberculosis and listeriosis were sporadically observed. The disease pattern in roe deer from Switzerland was largely in accordance with previous reports. The observed fluctuations were consistent with methodical and/or personnel changes and varying disease awareness. Nevertheless, despite such limitations, the compiled data provide a valuable baseline. To facilitate comparison among studies, we recommend systematically archiving all case documents and fixed tissues and to perform data analyses more regularly and in a harmonized way. © 2017 Pewsner et al.

Art Research Center (ARC) at Ritsumeikan University has developed digital archives for various Japanese ancient cultural materials. The ARC digital archive preserves a large amount of Ukiyo-e artworks. In this paper, we propose a recommender system that is suitable for the ARC Ukiyo-e digital archive, to help the users obtaining the interested Ukiyo-e artworks conveniently. The recommender algorithm is based on the user log data, which is easy to obtain and represents the user behaviors. The proposed method is named CARC, which uses restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) for collaborative filtering to initialize the recommendation list, and then uses content-based filtering (CBF) for generating more explicit recommendation list. The proposed recommender system is effective to extract the pattern of users’ behaviors and construct the recommendation list that fits the taste of users. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Digital archive; Japanese cultural heritage; Neural network; Recommender system; Restricted Boltzmann machine","Behavioral research; Collaborative filtering; Digital libraries; Neural networks; Art research; Content based filtering; Cultural heritages; Digital archives; Large amounts; Recommender algorithms; Restricted boltzmann machine; User behaviors; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Bohnert F., Zukerman I., Using keyword-based approaches to adaptively predict interest in museum exhibits, AI 2009.

Additional to the previous, users are exposed to route planning problems in which time should be considered as an important constraint. In this paper, the aim is to deal with these issues by providing users with constrained interest-based tour recommendations. A recommendation model is proposed to deal with the users information overload issue. A route planning algorithm supplied with recommendations by the recommendation model is designed to provide tour recommendations. The recommendation model as well as the route planning algorithm results are tested for various cases giving interesting outcomes. The recommendation model and the route planning algorithm are both integrated into the virtual environment and interoperating with navigation assistance methods to provide effective tour guide services applicable in virtual and physical environments. © 2015 IEEE.","cultural education; cultural heritage promotion; recommendation systems; route planning; tour recommendations; virtual environments","Information science; Virtual reality; Cultural education; Cultural heritages; Exposed to; Information overloads; Physical environments; Route planning; Tour guide; tour recommendations; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Lepouras G., Vassilakis C., Virtual museums for all: Employing game technology for edutainment, Virtual Reality, 8, 2, pp. 96-106, (2004); Ott M., Pozzi F., Towards a new era for cultural heritage education: Discussing the role of ict, Computers in Human Behavior, 27, 4, pp. 1365-1371, (2011); Addison A.C., Emerging trends in virtual heritage, MultiMedia, IEEE, 7, 2, pp. 22-25, (2000); Komianos V., Kavvadia E., Oikonomou K., Efficient and realistic cultural heritage representation in large scale virtual environments, Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications, IISA 2014, the 5th International Conference On.

Online friend recommendation is a rapid developing field in data mining. Current social networking services prescribe friends to users in light of their social graphs and mutual friends, which may not be the most proper to reflect a user's taste on friend selection in real lifetime. In this paper propose a system that recommends companions based on the daily activities of users. Here a semantic based friend recommendation is done based on the user's life styles such as posting, chatting, searching, commenting etc. By using text mining technique, we display a user's daily life as life archives, from which his/her ways of life are separated by using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. At that point we discover a similarity metric to quantify the similarity of life styles between users as an incremental way, and ascertain user effect as far as ways of life with a similarity matching diagram. Then calculate user impact ranking iterative matrix vector multiplication strategy in user incrementally, so that it would be versatile to vast scale frameworks. Ranking is mainly based on time spent on activities, profile information and feedback factor. At last, we incorporate a feedback component to further improve the proposal precision. © 2015 IEEE.","activity recognition; data mining; pattern recognition; similarity metric; social networks","Data mining; Iterative methods; Online systems; Pattern recognition; Semantics; Statistics; Activity recognition; Friend recommendations; Group recommendation systems; Latent Dirichlet allocation; On-line social networks; Similarity metrics; Social networking services; Text mining techniques; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Wang Z., Cao Q., Wang Z., Friendbook: A semantic based friend recommendation system for social networks, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing; Bian L., Holtzman H., Online friend recommendation through personality matching and collaborative filtering, Proc.

Since the application of these changes to all locations is time-consuming and error-prone, tools exist that learn change patterns from input examples, search for possible pattern applications, and generate corresponding recommendations. In many cases, the generated recommendations are syntactically or semantically wrong due to code movements in the input examples. Thus, they are of low accuracy and developers cannot directly copy them into their projects without adjustments. We present the Accurate REcommendation System (ARES) that achieves a higher accuracy than other tools because its algorithms take care of code movements when creating patterns and recommendations. On average, the recommendations by ARES have an accuracy of 96% with respect to code changes that developers have manually performed in commits of source code archives. At the same time ARES achieves precision and recall values that are on par with other tools. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Program transformation; Recommendation system; Refactoring","Codes (symbols); Recommender systems; Change patterns; Code changes; Error prones; Level change; Precision and recall; Program transformations; Refactorings; Software project; Software engineering","","","","","","","Eclipse JDT Repository.

The system ranks the alternative destinations by using the point and click technique during the process. The core of the system is a hybrid image filtering mechanism, which utilize both collaborative and content-based filtering. At first, the user profile is modelled in the form of a distance matrix, exploiting the user's annotations over a small set of descriptive images. At the same time, user's profile is compared to other profiles; the k closest profiles are utilized to refine the distance matrix. Then, the system provides relevant images to the user asking him/her to select few. The selected images are used in order to rank the alternative monuments.

In this work, we address the problem of generating and then recommending an artworks sequence for a group of visitors within a museum. Differently from a recommender system for an e-commerce application, the problem, here, is trying to maximize the satisfaction of the proposed recommendations, while taking into account an items' ordering that satisfies each group member during the sequence and the artworks location in the museum.

In this paper we propose a recommendation system for automated selection of Universal decimal classification (UDC) indices for physical and mathematical documents. This system implements one of the services of the digital mathematical library Lobachevskii-DML. The proposed algorithm is based on the use of terms extracted from the title, the list of keywords and annotations given in the analyzed documents. Extraction of terms from the documents of the collection is carried out with the help of software tools developed by us, taking into account the stylistic features of the documents and the positions in the text of the required terms. The data obtained were included in a dictionary that has an inverted index structure. The generated dictionary contains both classification features and sets of key terms, which are used to systematize and classify the material. Most of these terms were obtained by automated processing of the collection of archives of physical and mathematical publications of the All-Russian mathematical portal Math-Net.Ru. The proposed variant of the semantic markup of a table of indices of the Universal decimal classification. The model of classification of scientific documents is described. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

Traditional recommendation algorithms, e.g. collaborative filtering and matrix completion, are not designed to exploit the key information hidden in the text comments, while existing opinion mining methods do not provide direct support to recommendation systems with useful features on users and items. Our approach attempts to construct vectors to represent profiles of users and items under a unified framework to maximize word appearance likelihood. Then, the vector representations are used for a recommendation task in which we predict scores on unobserved user-item pairs without given texts. The recommendation-aware distributed representation approach is fully supported by effective and efficient learning algorithms over massive text archive. Our empirical evaluations on real datasets show that our system outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline systems. © 1963-2018 ACL.","","Computational linguistics; Mining; Recommender systems; Sentiment analysis; Baseline systems; Distributed representation; Empirical evaluations; Matrix completion; Recommendation algorithms; State of the art; Unified framework; Vector representations; Collaborative filtering","","","","","Singapores A*STAR; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61373095, 61502325, 61572338)","Funding text 1: is supported by the research grant for the Human Centered Cyber-physical Systems Programme at the Advanced Digital Sciences Center from Singapores A*STAR.

Museums must seek the perfect balance of information given on individual pieces in order to provide sufficient information to aid visitor understanding while maintaining sparse usage of the walls and guaranteeing high appreciation of the exhibit. Moreover, museums often target the interests of average visitors instead of the entire spectrum of different interests each individual visitor might have. Finally, visiting a museum should not be an experience contained in the physical space of the museum but a door opened onto a broader context of related artworks, authors, artistic trends, etc. In this paper we describe the MNEMOSYNE system that attempts to address these issues through a new multimedia museum experience. Based on passive observation, the system builds a profile of the artworks of interest for each visitor. These profiles of interest are then used to drive an interactive table that personalizes multimedia content delivery. The natural user interface on the interactive table uses the visitor’s profile, an ontology of museum content and a recommendation system to personalize exploration of multimedia content. At the end of their visit, the visitor can take home a personalized summary of their visit on a custom mobile application. In this article we describe in detail each component of our approach as well as the first field trials of our prototype system built and deployed at our permanent exhibition space at LeMurate (http://www.lemurate.comune.fi.it/lemurate/) in Florence together with the first results of the evaluation process during the official installation in the National Museum of Bargello (http://www.uffizi.firenze.it/musei/?m=bargello). © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.","Computer vision; Cultural heritage; Multimedia museum; Natural interaction; Passive profiling; Personalization; Video surveillance","Computer vision; Digital storage; Exhibitions; Security systems; User interfaces; Cultural heritages; Natural interactions; Passive profiling; Personalizations; Video surveillance; Museums","","","","","Thales Italia, (POR-FSE 2007-2013, RYC-2012-11776)","This work was partially supported by Thales Italia and the MNEMOSYNE project (POR-FSE 2007-2013, A.IV-OB.2).

Motivated by the scenario, we set out to design and implement a group recommender system, Museum Guides for Groups (MGG), that provides visitors to a museum with a sequence of items of interest by efficiently clustering visitors of similar user profiles into groups and computing recommendations for each group. Our work in progress was reported, focusing on the system design and the selection of an appropriate clustering algorithm for dividing visitors. We evaluated the efficiency of three candidate clustering techniques, including the bisecting K-Means, DBSCAN, and improved CURE, using the MovieLens dataset with 1M ratings. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Clustering algorithm; Group recommendation; User profile","Museums; Systems analysis; Cloud computing; Clustering techniques; Computational resources; Cultural resources; Design and implements; Group recommendations; Group recommender systems; User profile; Work in progress; Clustering algorithms","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2015BAK25B03)","This work was funded by the Open Project Program of Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring and Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology Project (PAPD and CICAEET).

Methods: A qualitative media content analysis centered on PC information delivered by French professional media. The selected data were produced in the aftermath of the High Health Authority’s decision in 2008 not to recommend systematic screening by prostate specific antigen (PSA) for men over 50. Source was the Media Archives of the French National Library. Content was analyzed from 15 television programs, 14 radio programs, and 55 articles from 35 popular French newspapers (online and printed, weekly and monthly) and 20 magazines. Audio content was narrated into textual form and submitted to manual coding along with the print content. Results: Television and radio content focused on the nature of PC, screening and treatment, and conveyed a gender-centric position linked to male sexuality and virility. Newspapers and magazines targeted the testing controversy, the lack of consensus among professionals, and scientific advances in screening and treatment. Conclusion: Media participation in the European testing debate is valuable for allowing patients to hear all opinions on PC risk factors. Debate on testing policy contributes to confusion and uncertainty regarding appropriate action. © 2018 The Author(s).","Health education; Health messages; Media content analysis; Prostate cancer","","","","","","Ryerson University","Union for International Cancer Control-Yamagiwa-Yoshida Memorial International Study Grant-Japan National Committee for UICC and Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co.

This knowledge can be then used along with context to give tailored advice. Methods of monitoring visitor behavior, converting that to traits and that to personality types are described.

While there are a large amount of prior works on personalized Point of Interests (POI) recommendation systems, they used supervised learning approaches that did not work for users who have little or no historic (training) data. In this paper, we focused on an interesting place discovery problem where the goal is to accurately discover the interesting places in a city that average people may have strong interests to visit (e.g., parks, museums, historic sites, etc.) using unsupervised approaches. In particular, we develop a new Physical-Social-aware Interesting Place Discovery (PSIPD) scheme which jointly exploits the location's physical dependency and the visitor's social dependency to solve the interesting place discovery problem using an unsupervised approach. We compare our solution with state-ofthe- art baselines using two real world data traces from LBSN. The results showed that our approach achieved significant performance improvements compared to all baselines in terms of both estimation accuracy and ranking performance. © 2016 IEEE.","Interesting place discovery;

Personalization is called for. The same observation holds for online behavior with interactive systems. It is natural to represent the behavior of users who are engaging with interactive systems such as a search engine or a recommender system, as a sequence of actions where each next action depends on the current situation and the user reward of taking a particular action. By and large, current online evaluation metrics for interactive systems such as search engines or recommender systems, are static and do not reflect differences in user behavior. They rarely capture or model the reward experienced by a user while interacting with an interactive system.We argue that knowing a user's reward function is essential for an interactive system as both for learning and evaluation. We propose to learn users' reward functions directly from observed interaction traces. In particular, we present how users' reward functions can be uncovered directly using inverse reinforcement learning techniques. We also show how to incorporate user features into the learning process. Our main contribution is a novel and dynamic approach to restore a user's reward function. We present an analytic approach to this problem and complement it with initial experiments using the interaction logs of a cultural heritage institution that demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by uncovering different reward functions for different user groups. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Interactive systems; Inverse reinforcement learning; Online evaluation","Behavioral research; Function evaluation; Information retrieval; Inverse problems; Learning systems; Online systems; Reinforcement learning; Search engines; Analytic approach; Cultural heritages; Current situation; Dynamic approaches; Interactive system; Inverse reinforcement learning; On-line evaluation; Sequence of actions; Recommender systems","","","","","Dutch national program COMMIT; FP7/2007; Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision; Microsoft Research; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (312827); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (612.001.-116, 612.001.551, 652.001.003, 652.002.001, CI-14-25, HOR-11-10); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","Acknowledgments.

While the surviving exhibition catalogues are a rich information source, they are largely devoid of illustrations of the exhibits. The FuzzyPhoto project has developed techniques for analyzing a corpus of more than 1.4 million historical photographic records across different galleries, libraries, archives, and museums, in order to identify similarities between them and used the results to offer visitors to those sites links to potentially related items at other sites, thus creating a web of interconnections between them. The article describes techniques used for data acquisition, cleaning, integration, semantic- based data mining, approximate reasoning, and fuzzy algorithm-based similarity metrics. It compares the approach described here with manual searches and more sophisticated computational methods such as linked data and concludes that FuzzyPhoto is an effective method for dealing with the realities of messy collection records that could be extended to other types of archival objects such as paintings, maps, and textiles where record matching is required.  © The Author 2015.","","","","","","","Birmingham City Library; British Library, Muse?; National Media Museum; National Museums Scotland; Metropolitan Museum of Art; Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC, (AH/J004367/1); University of St Andrews","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council [Research Grant AH/J004367/1].

We present a theoretical research work about recommendation using biclustering. Our approach is based on biclustering using FCA and partition pattern structures. First, we recall a previous method of recommendation based on constant-column biclusters. Then, we propose an alternative approach that incorporates an order information and that uses coherent-evolution-on-columns biclusters. This alternative approach shares some common features with sequential pattern mining. Finally, given a dataset of visitor trajectories, we indicate how these approaches can be used to build a collaborative recommendation strategy. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

In its call to action the EU has also, namely through the Active Assisted Living Programme (AALP)1, encouraged the groups engaged in the development of these new solutions to involve end-users in the design process. Literature is profuse in examples of the application of human-centred design (HCD) principles, participatory design or co-creation with different types of end-users. On the other hand, it might be difficult for researchers and developers to find concentrated examples of, and reflexions on, the application of these methods and techniques with older adults.

Technologies are changing the role of such spaces, allowing a more in-depth knowledge diffusion and social interactions. Static places become dynamic cultural environments in which people can discover and share new knowledge. Nowadays, cultural heritage is approaching to a new digital era in which people become active elements, as recipients of the actions ensuring the sustainability of such heritage, both moneywise but also simply as the perceived quality of life. In this perspective, this paper presents a novel recommender system to individual and people group in order to create a social recommendation service for cultural ICT applications. As key aspect of the presented work, we introduce a method for discovering and exploiting social affinity between users based on artwork features and user experience. In addition, we propose an architecture of the recommender system related with the affinity and discuss the architecture in terms of sparsity, group recommendation, and sustainability. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.","Cultural heritage; Recommender systems; Social affinity; Social network service","Network architecture; Sustainable development; Cultural environment; Cultural heritages; Group recommendations; In-depth knowledge; Perceived quality; Social affinity; Social interactions; Social network services; Recommender systems","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF-2014R1A2A2A05007154); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) (NRF-2014R1A2A2A05007154).","Agarwal V., Bharadwaj K.K., A collaborative filtering framework for friends recommendation in social networks based on interaction intensity and adaptive user similarity, Soc Netw Anal Min, 3, 3, pp. 359-379, (2013); Bamberger Y., Tal T., Multiple outcomes of class visits to natural history museums: the students’ view, J Sci Educ Technol, 17, 3, pp. 274-284, (2008); Bello-Orgaz G., Jung J.J., Camacho D., Social big data: recent achievements and new challenges, Inf Fusion, 28, pp. 45-59, (2016); Benouaret I., IEEE international conference on systems, man, and cybernetics, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, October 2015.

In the course of a long-term research project, research into one area can extend over several days, weeks, or even months. Interruptions are unavoidable, and, when multiple team members have to discuss the status of a project, it's important to be able to communicate the current research status easily and accurately. Multiple type-specific interactive views can help users identify the results most relevant to their focus of interest. Our recommendation dashboard uses micro-filter visualizations intended to improve the experience of working with multiple active filters, allowing researchers to maintain an overview of their progress. Within this paper, we carry out an evaluation of whether micro-visualizations help to increase the memorability and readability of active filters in comparison to textual filters. Five tasks, quantitative and qualitative questions, and the separate view on the different visualisation types enabled us to gain insights on how micro-visualisations behave and will be discussed throughout the paper.

This challenge is particularly perceived in the Italian scenario, where the artistic patrimony is one of the most diverse and rich of the world, able to attract millions of visitors every year to monuments, archaeological sites and museums. In this paper, we present a general recommendation framework able to uniformly manage heterogeneous multimedia data coming from several web repositories and to provide context-aware recommendation techniques supporting intelligent multimedia services for the users—i.e. dynamic visiting paths for a given environment.

Each recommendation consists of a single item, e.g., a movie or a book. However, these ranked lists are not suitable for applications such as travel planning, which deal with heterogeneous items. In fact, in such applications, there is a need to recommend packages the user can choose from, each package being a set of Points of Interest (POIs), e.g., museums, parks, monuments, etc. In this paper, we focus on the problem of recommending a set of packages to the user, where each package is constituted with a set of POIs that may constitute a tour. Given a collection of POIs, where each POI has a cost and a time associated with it, and the user specifying a maximum total value for both the cost and the time (budgets), our goal is to recommend the most interesting packages for the user, where each package satisfies the budget constraints. We formally define the problem and we present a novel composite recommendation system, inspired from composite retrieval. We introduce a scoring function and propose a ranking algorithm that takes into account the preferences of the user, the diversity of POIs included in the package, as well as the popularity of POIs in the package. Extensive experimental evaluation of our proposed system, using a real dataset demonstrates its quality and its ability to improve both diversity and relevance of recommendations. © 2016 IEEE.","Diversity; Package; Recommender system; Top-k; Trip planning","Budget control; Packaging; Budget constraint; Diversity; Experimental evaluation; Points of interest; Ranking algorithm; Scoring functions; Travel planning; Trip planning; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Amer-Yahia S., Bonchi F., Castillo C., Feuerstein E., Mendez-Diaz I., Zabala P., Composite retrieval of diverse and complementary bundles, TKDE, (2014); Clarke C.L., Kolla M., Cormack G.V., Vechtomova O., Ashkan A., Buttcher S., MacKinnon I., Novelty and diversity in information retrieval evaluation, ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, (2008); Bradley K., Smyth B., Improving recommendation diversity, Proceedings of the Twelfth Irish Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science, Maynooth, Ireland.

They possess equally important knowledge to that of professionals. Effectively informing them about new project features is the first step in engaging them in the decision making and harnessing their knowledge. However, given the complexity and diversity of project information, citizens could face an information overload. Our objective is to support the delivery of the right information to the right person; and doing so in an adaptive manner that recognizes the needs of local context. We have developed a system that allows users to profile their information needs based on an ontology of user communications. Recommender algorithms are then used to match user profile to the most relevant knowledge items, such as documents, web pages, and tagged videos or images. Users who wish to rate or tag documents can do so through using concepts from the ontology or free text. If free text is used, semantic analysis is conducted to extract relevant tags. Tags are then fed-back into the recommender system to enhance its accuracy. Capturing community tags provides a good opportunity to use crowd input to contextualise the matching algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Co-creation; Community engagement; Crowdsourcing; Ontology; Project communication system; Recommender systems","Crowdsourcing; Decision making; Ontology; Semantics; Smart city; Websites; Co-creation; Community engagement; Decision making process; Information delivery; Information overloads; Project communications; Project informations; Recommender algorithms; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Barbieri N., Manco G., Ritacco E., Probabilistic approaches to recommendations, Synthesis Lectures on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 5, 2, pp. 1-197, (2014); Bare J., Young D., QAM S., Hopton M., Chief S.A.B., Tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and other environmental impacts (TRACI), (2012); Bolisani E., Debei S., Savino N., Renovating project management: Knowledge personalization and sharing, Knowledge and project management, pp. 131-153, (2017); Burke R., Hybrid recommender systems: Survey and experiments, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 12, 4, pp. 331-370, (2012); Caldas C.H., Soibelman L., Automating hierarchical document classification for construction management information systems, Automation in Construction, 12, 4, pp. 395-406, (2003); Demian P., Balatsoukas P., Information retrieval from civil engineering repositories: Importance of context and granularity, Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, pp. 727-740, (2012); El-Diraby T.E., Osman H., A domain ontology for construction concepts in urban infrastructure products, Automation in Construction, 20, 8, pp. 1120-1132, (2011); El-Diraby T.E., Wang B., E-society portal: Integrating urban highway construction projects into the knowledge city, J. of Construction Engineering and Management, 131, 11, pp. 1196-1211, (2005); El-Diraby T.E., A Domain ontology for construction knowledge, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 139, 7, pp. 23-34, (2013); El-Diraby T.E., Validating AEC informatics ontologies: Approaches and lessons learned, The Journal of Information Technology in Construction (ITcon), (2013); El-Gohary N.M., El-Diraby T.E., Domain ontology for processes in infrastructure and construction, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 136, 7, pp. 730-744, (2010); Fan H., Xue F., Li H., Project-based as-needed information retrieval from unstructured AEC documents, Journal of Management in Engineering, (2014); Fernandez-Lopez M., Gomez-Perez A., Juristo N., METHONTOLOGY: From ontological art to ontological engineering, Spring symposium on ontological engineering of AAAI, Stanford, CA, (1997); Gomez-Perez A., Evaluation of ontologies, International Journal of Intelligent Systems, 16, 3, pp. 391-409, (2001); GRI-Global reporting Initiative, Sustainability reporting guidelines, (2011); Gangemi A., Catenacci C., Ciaramita M., Lehmann J., Modelling ontology evaluation and validation, Proceedings of the 2006 European semantic web conference, (2006); Gohari F.S., Tarokh M.J., Classification and comparison of the hybrid collaborative filtering systems, International Journal of Research in Industrial Engineering, 4, 2, pp. 129-148, (2017); Gruninger M., Fox M.S., Methodology for the design and evaluation of ontologies, IJCAI95 workshop on basic ontological issues in knowledge sharing, Montreal, Canada, (1995); Guarino N., Welty C., An overview of OntoClean, Handbook on ontologies, (2004); Herlocker J.L., Konstan J.A., Terveen L.G., Riedl J.T., Evaluating collaborative filtering recommender systems, ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 22, 1, pp. 5-53, (2004); Klein M., Noy N.F., A component-based framework for ontology evolution, Workshop on Ontologies and Distributed Systems at IJCAI, 3, (2013); Kontio J., Lehtola L., Bragge J., Using the focus group method in software engineering: obtaining practitioner and user experiences, Empirical Software Engineering, 2004.

An automatic content-based annotation and recommendation system for music recordings is independent of originally available metadata. It allows for generating an objective metadata that can complement manual expert annotations. These metadata can be effectively used for navigation and search in large music databases of broadcasting stations, streaming services, or online music archives. Automatically determined similar music pieces can serve for user-centered playlist creation and recommendation. In this paper we propose a combined approach to automatic music annotation and similarity search based on musically relevant low-level and mid-level descriptors. First, we use machine learning to infer the high-level metadata categories like genre, emotion, and perceived tempo. These descriptors are then used for similarity search. The similarity criteria can be individually weighted and adapted specifically to specific user requirements and musical facets as rhythm or harmony. The proposed method on music annotation is evaluated on an expert-annotated dataset reaching average accuracies of 60% to 90%, depending on a metadata category. An evaluation for the music recommendation is conducted for different similarity criteria showing good results for rhythm and tempo similarity with precision of 0.51 and 0.71 respectively. © 2017 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

In this paper, we examine the multidimensionality of visitor experience, specifically the components and factors that shape it. We present a framework that is built on existing bodies of knowledge about visitor experience and that serves as a starting point to further evaluate the transformations caused by the integration of recommender systems in museums. We then conclude that current approaches to testing the impact of recommender systems on visitor experience should be expanded beyond evaluations of user satisfaction level to include the demonstrated aspects of visitor experience. This research aims to contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the differences between visitor and user experience types as well as to address the need for a more comprehensive set of guidelines to evaluate how recommender systems enhance visitor experience in physical museums.

Visitors of museums are often overwhelmed by the information available in the space they are exploring. Therefore, finding relevant artworks to see in a limited amount of time is a crucial task. In this paper, we present a recommender system for mobile devices that (1) adapts to the users profiles and (2) is sensitive to their context (location, time, expertise, etc.). Our system aims to improve the visitors' experience and help them build their tours on-site according to their preferences and constraints. We first describe our recommendation framework, which consists in a hybrid recommendation system. It combines a semantic approach for the representation of museum domain using ontologies and thesauruses with a semantically-enhanced collaborative filtering method. Then, we present a contextual post filtering that enables the generation of a highly personalized tour based on the physical environment, the location of the visitors and the time they want to spend in the museum. © 2015 IEEE.","assistive navigation; semantic path planning; SLAM; wearable device","Collaborative filtering; Cybernetics; Indoor positioning systems; Mobile devices; Motion planning; Museums; Navigation systems; Semantics; Assistive navigations; Collaborative filtering methods; Hybrid recommendation; Indoor navigation system; Physical environments; SLAM; Visually-impaired users; Wearable devices; Recommender systems","","","","","","","World Health Organization-Visual Impairment and Blindness, (2013); Shim I., Yoon J., A robotic cane based on interactive technology, IECON 02 [Industrial Electronics Society IEEE 2002 28th Annual Conference of The], 3, pp. 2249-2254, (2002); Yuan D., Manduchi R., A tool for range sensing and environment discovery for the blind, Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop, (2004); Calder D.J., Assistive technologies and the visually impaired: A digital ecosystem perspective, Proceedings of the 3rdInternational Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments, Ser.

Radi-ology training may have several challenges such as image retrieval, extraction of knowledge, education towards solving problems and the interaction with huge repositories known as Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). This project proposes a user-based system that learns from user interaction, retrieving not just the requested information but recommending related cases and interesting images. The recommended images are retrieved using a Click-through rate (CTR) strategy for defining the most similar cases in the database. This is a fully web-based proposal, potentially useful at classroom or home, that allows students to develop the clinical skills needed in a more realistic scenario. © 2017 SPIE.","Data collection; Information storage and retrieval; Knowledge; Medical informatics; Picture archiving and communication systems; Radiology education; Recommender system; Software design","Bioinformatics; Computer aided instruction; Digital storage; Education; Image communication systems; Image retrieval; Medical information systems; Picture archiving and communication systems; Radiation; Radiology; Recommender systems; Software design; Students; User interfaces; Click-through rate; Data collection; Image retrieval systems; Information storage and retrieval; Knowledge; Medical informatics; Modern technologies; Picture archiving and communication systems (PACS); Search engines","","","","","","","Cai T.W., Kim J., Feng D.D., 4-Content-based medical image retrieval, Biomedical Information Technology, Biomedical Engineering, pp. 83-113, (2008); Camargo J.E., Gonzalez F.A., Multimodal image collection summarization using non negative matrix factorization, Computing Congress (CCC), 2011 6th Colombian, pp. 1-6, (2011); Carestream Vue Pacs, (2015); Corporation N., Novapacs, (2015); De Ves E., Domingo J., Ayala G., Zuccarello P., A novel Bayesian framework for relevance feedback in image content-based retrieval systems, Pattern Recognition, 39, 9, pp. 1622-1632, (2006); Dimitrovski I., Kocev D., Kitanovski I., Loskovska S., Dzeroski S., Improved medical image modality classification using a combination of visual and textual features, Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics : The Official Journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society, 39, pp. 14-26, (2015); Dong P., Qin Gao Z., Wu Li Y., Zhu H., Zhen Wang X., Wang B., Feng Long J., The con-struction of medical imaging network teaching system with the pacs in university, Systems and Informatics (ICSAI), 2012 International Conference on, pp. 1023-1025, (2012); Thao C., Goldminer: A Radiology Image Search Engine, (2015); Kangarloo H., Pacs clinical experience at ucla, PACS in Medicine, Volume 74 of NATO ASI Series, pp. 189-194, (1991); Kaul C., Kaul A., Verma S., Comparative study on healthcare prediction systems using big data, IEEE 2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information,Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS), (2015); Liu Y., Zhang D., Lu G., Ma W.-Y., A survey of content-based image retrieval with high-level semantics, Pattern Recognition, 40, 1, pp. 262-282, (2007); Monteiro E., Valente F., Costa C., Oliveira J.L., A recommender system for medical imaging diagnostic, Digital Healthcare Empowering Europeans, (2015); Osirixhd, (2011); Subramaniam R.M., Kim C., Scally P., Tress B., Medical student radiology training: What are the objectives for contemporary medical practice?, Journal of the Association of University Radiologists, (2003); Thomee B., Lew M.S., Interactive search in image retrieval, International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval, 1, pp. 71-86, (2012); Valente F., Costa C., Silva A., Dicoogle, A Pacs Featuring Profiled Content Based Image Retrieval, (2012); Wang X.-Y., Yang H.-Y., Li Y.-W., Li W.-Y., Chen J.-W., A new SVM-based active feedback scheme for image retrieval, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 37, pp. 43-53, (2015); Wang X.-Z., Shen Z., Dong P., Wu Li Y., Wang B., Xiang Chen J., Feng Long J., Quan Sun Y., Using the imaging network teaching system based on pacs in improvement of teaching effect in medical imaging, Systems and Informatics (ICSAI), 2012 International Conference on, pp. 1043-1045, (2012); Zare M.R., Mueen A., Seng W.C., Automatic classification of medical x-ray images using a bag of visual words, IET Computer Vision, 7, 2, pp. 105-114, (2013)","Colombia","Romero E.; Lepore N.; Brieva J.; Larrabide I.","SPIE","et al.; Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Productiva (MinCyT); SIPAIM Foundation; Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (UNICEN); Universidad Panamericana","12th International Symposium on Medical Information Processing and Analysis, SIPAIM 2016","5 December 2016 through 7 December 2016","Tandil","126573","0277786X","978-151060778-1","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014679435"

Personal information are not distributed in the Internet randomly, but archived in several social media under a certain rule, which is called the different characters of social media. When sources of complementary information are integrated, the fused social data of people will have broad prospect in the area of recommendation system and security. A key problem for social data fusion is to discover multiple accounts of a single person across different social media. In this paper, we propose a methodology for user identity resolution based on user's basic information and social network. The approach accomplishes this task by measuring the similarity of vertices. Finally, we use calculation results to evaluate these methods' accuracy rate. © 2015 IEEE.","Identity Resolution; Similarity Measure; Social Media; Social Network","Big data; Cloud computing; Data fusion; Accuracy rate; Calculation results; Identity resolutions; Key technologies; Personal information; Similarity measure; Social media; User identity; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Raad E., Chbeir R., Dipanda A., User profile matching in social networks [A], Network-Based Information Systems (NBiS), 2010 13th International Conference on [C], pp. 297-304, (2010); Vosecky J., Hong D., Shen V.Y., User identification across multiple social networks [A], Networked Digital Technologies, 2009.

Design/methodology/approach – The research methodology employs a qualitative exploratory multi-case study: the method used has consisted in crossing the information currently known on the most advanced communication technologies (ICT) with the requirements of enhancing museum services, in order to determine the possible trajectories of applying the former to the latter. Findings – The implementation of recommender system outlines the main implications and effects of an advanced market-driven digital orientation, as the system’s users are the starting point for innovation and the creation of value. For a museum, it will be possible to access to an additional system of knowledge alongside that of its scientific staff. This process has profound implications in the way in which a museum presents itself and how it is perceived by its visitors and, in a wider sense, by the potential demand. Research limitations/implications – The paper consists in an exploratory effort to introduce an analytical framework for an evolved adaptive museum orientation system; the empirical investigation can be structured in the inductive-predictive view of assessing this promising debate further. Originality/value – Implementing the IoT blueprint entails introducing a plethora of new products, services and business models, opening new routes to guide and direct cultural events. Now, more than ever, sustainable development involves an intrinsic balancing act between the pluralism of data and that of customer needs, which is achieved through the elaboration of digital data. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","IoT; Learning organizations; Museum knowledge; Museum visitors; Recommendation systems; Visiting behaviour","","","","","","","","Adomavicius G., Tuzhilin A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: a survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions, Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions, 17, 6, pp. 734-749, (2005); Atzori L., Iera A., Morabito G., From smart objects to social objects: the next evolutionary step of the Internet of Things, Communications Magazine, IEEE, 52, 1, pp. 97-105, (2014); Bitgood S., Museum fatigue: a critical review, Visitor Studies, 12, 2, pp. 93-111, (2009); Bradford H., A new framework for museum marketing, Museums Management, pp. 41-50, (1994); Burke R., Hybrid recommender systems: survey and experiments, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 12, 4, pp. 331-370, (2002); Campanella F., Del Giudice M., Della Peruta M.R., The role of information in the credit relationship, Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, 2, 1, pp. 1-16, (2013); Campanella F., Della Peruta M.R., Del Giudice M., The role of sociocultural background on the characteristics and the financing of youth entrepreneurship.

The key research challenge for 4D modelling, was the data collection over heterogeneous unstructured web resources. Such “in the wild” data include outliers and significant noise, since they have not been created for 3D modelling and reconstruction purposes. In addition, GPS and geo-information is limited or non-existent. However, such data allow for a massive reconstruction of the content even for monuments that have been destroyed due to natural phenomena or humans’ interventions. The key outcomes include (i) a Twitter-based 3D modelling of CH objects so as to reconstruct CH monuments and sites from unstructured image content, (ii) the development of a search engine and a (iii) recommendation system for different CH actors (curators, conservators, researchers), (iv) 3D reconstruction of the historic city of Calw in Germany, (v) the creation of a 3D virtual environment in real-time and (vi) launch of a 4D viewer enabling the easy handling of the 3D geometry plus the time. The results show the main innovation of the proposed 4D dimension, i.e., the time in precise modelling of the rich geometric content of the monuments. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","3D reconstruction, tweets analysis and recommendation systems; 4D modelling; Tangible cultural heritage","Geometry; Image reconstruction; Recommender systems; Search engines; Virtual reality; 3-D virtual environment; 3D reconstruction; 4d modelling; Cultural heritage objects; Cultural heritages; Geometric variations; Natural phenomena; Research challenges; Three dimensional computer graphics","","","","","Four Dimensional Cultural Heritage World; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Commission, EC, (324523, 691218); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","Acknowledgement.

However, in order to be effectively used, several problems have to be addressed: user preferences are not expressed as rating, items to be suggested are located in a physical space, and users may be in a group. In this work, we present a general framework that, by using the Matrix Factorization (MF) approach and a graph representation of a museum, addresses the problem of generating and then recommending an artworks sequence for a group of visitors within a museum. To reach a high-quality initial personalization, the recommendation system uses a simple, but efficient, elicitation method that is inspired by the MF approach. Moreover, the proposed approach considers the individual or the aggregated artworks' ratings to build up a solution that takes into account the physical location of the artworks.","Collaborative Filtering; Cultural Heritage; Elicitations; Sequence Recommendations","Factorization; Health care; Museums; Recommender systems; Collaborative filtering methods; Cultural heritages; Elicitation methods; Elicitations; Graph representation; Matrix factorizations; Preference elicitation; Sequence Recommendations; Collaborative filtering","","","","","","","Van Hage W.R., Stash N., Wang Y., Aroyo L., The Semantic Web: Research and Applications: 7th Extended Semantic Web Conference, ESWC, Proceedings, Part I, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Berlin, Heidelberg, pp. 46-59, (2010); Bohnert F., Schmidt D.F., Zukerman I., Spatial processes for recommender systems, Proceedings of the 21st International Jont Conference on Artifical Intelligence, IJCAI'09, pp. 2022-2027, (2009); Roes I., Stash N., Wang Y., Aroyo L., A personalized walk through the museum: The chip interactive tour guide, CHI '09 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 3317-3322, (2009); Amato F., Chianese A., Mazzeo A., Moscato V., Picariello A., Piccialli F., The talking museum project, Procedia Computer Science 21 (2013) 114-121, 4th International Conference on Emerging Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks (EUSPN-2013) and the 3rd International Conference on Current and Future Trends of Information and Communication Technologies in Healthcare (ICTH); Caso A., Rossi S., Users ranking in online social networks to support pois selection in small groups, Posters, Demos, Late-breaking Results and Workshop Proceedings of the 22nd Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization, 1181, (2014); Rossi S., Caso A., Barile F., Combining users and items rankings for group decision support, Trends in Practical Applications of Agents, Multi-Agent Systems and Sustainability, 372, pp. 151-158, (2015); Lops P., De Gemmis M., Semeraro G., Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 73-105, (2011); Koren Y., Bell R., Volinsky C., Matrix factorization techniques for recommender systems, Computer, 42, 8, pp. 30-37, (2009); Loepp B., Hussein T., Ziegler J., Choice-based preference elicitation for collaborative filtering recommender systems, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, ACM, pp. 3085-3094, (2014); Sato H., Royset J.O., Path optimization for the resource-constrained searcher, Naval Research Logistics (NRL), 57, 5, pp. 422-440, (2010); Desrochers M., Soumis F., A generalized permanent labeling algorithm for the shortest-path problem with time windows, Infor, 26, 3, pp. 191-212, (1988); Irnich S., Desaulniers G., Et al., Shortest path problems with resource constraints, Column Generation, 6730, pp. 33-65, (2005); Masthoff J., Gatt A., Pursuit of satisfaction and the prevention of embarrassment: Affective state in group recommender systems, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 16, 3-4, pp. 281-319, (2006); Rossi S., Cervone F., Social utilities and personality traits for group recommendation: A pilot user study, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence, pp. 38-46, (2016)","Italy","Shakshuki E.","Elsevier B.V.","Edge Hill University; ELSEVIER; IMOB-EN; Universiteit Hasselt; University of Surrey","7th International Conference on Emerging Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks, EUSPN 2016 / The 6th International Conference on Current and Future Trends of Information and Communication Technologies in Healthcare, ICTH-2016 / Affiliated Workshops, 2016","19 September 2016 through 22 September 2016","London","131700","18770509","","","","English","Procedia Comput.

Publicized temporary exhibitions can draw many visitors to a museum, urged by the opportunity of seeing certain items, but in general there are no particular stimuli and the visits are postponed once and again, if not forever. In this paper, we argue that it is possible to instigate curiosity in relation to dates, periods and events that are relevant to the potential visitors and connected to the cultural heritage items in direct or subtle ways. Likewise, proper reasoning about dates can improve the experiences of actual visitors, by promoting serendipitous learning, increasing retention and revealing that subsequent visits may drive them around the venue following new appealing narratives. We present the outline of a recommender system grounded on rich semantic modeling of relevant dates in the user profiles, in the cultural heritage knowledge bases and in an almanac of important days, connected to keywords and/or historical events and characters. We also explain how this system is going to be used in the pilot experiments of the CROSSCULT EU project, starting in September 2017. © 2017 IEEE.","Cultural heritage; knowledge modeling; personal/historical events; recommender systems","Recommender systems; Social networking (online); Cultural heritages; Eu projects; Knowledge basis; Knowledge model; personal/historical events; Pilot experiment; Semantic Model; User profile; Semantics","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (693150)","This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 693150.","Ambach J., Perrone C., Repenning A., Remote exploratoriums: Combining network media and design environments, Computers and Education, 24, 3, pp. 163-176, (1995); Shahani L., Nikonanou N., Economou M., Museums opening up to communities using web 2.0: Promise or reality?, International Journal of the Inclusive Museum, 1, 4, pp. 57-66, (2008); Ardissono L., Kuflik T., Petrelli D., Personalization in cultural heritage: The road travelled and the one ahead, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 22, 1-2, pp. 73-99, (2012); Myers D., Dalgity A., Avramides I., The arches heritage inventory and management system: A platform for the heritage field, Journal of Cultural Heritage Management and Sustainable Development, 6, 2, pp. 213-224, (2016); Hanzal T., Modeling Events on the Semantic Web, (2015); Farber M., Bartscherer F., Menne C., Rettinger A., Linked Data quality of DBpedia, Freebase, OpenCyc, Wikidata, and YAGO, Semantic Web Journal, pp. 3813-3842, (2016); Galton A., On what goes on: The ontology of processes and events, Proceedings of 4th International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS), (2006); Hyvonen E., Alm O., Kuittinen H., Using an ontology of historical events in semantic portals for cultural heritage, Proceedings of Cultural Heritage on the Semantic Web Workshop, in Conjunction with 6th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC), (2007); Ide N., Woolner D., Words and Intelligence II, pp. 137-152, (2007); Rabinowitz A., It's about Time: Historical Periodization and Linked Ancient World Data, 7, 22; Corda I., Dimitrova V., Bennett B., A logical model of an event ontology for exploring connections in historical domains, Proceedings of Workshop on Detection, Representation and Exploitation of Events in Semantic Web (Derive 2011), in Conjunction with 10th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC), (2011); Ramli F., Mohd Noah S., Building an event ontology for historical domain to support semantic document retrieval, International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology, 6, 6, pp. 1154-1160, (2016); Chianese A., Piccialli F., A smart system to manage the context evolution in the cultural heritage domain, Computers and Electrical Engineering, 55, pp. 27-38, (2016); Bartolini I., Moscato V., Pensa R., Penta A., Picariello A., Sansone C., Sapino M., Recommending multimedia visiting paths in cultural heritage applications, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 75, 7, pp. 3813-3842, (2016); Benouaret I., Lenne D., Personalizing the museum experience through context-aware recommendations, Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), (2015); Boud D., Reflection, Turning Experience into Learning.

One of the more obvious applications of such systems in the Cultural Heritage domain is to assist users when visiting cultural environments (such as museums, archaeological sites, old town centers and so on), providing a multimedia guide that is able to dynamically suggest relevant information available in multiple web repositories (e.g. multimedia sharing systems and on-line social networks). In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation approach that combines several aspects of users - i.e. their preferences (usually in the shape of items' metadata) and interactions within a social community modeled using hypergraphs - together with items' multimedia features and context information within a general framework that can support different applications (touristic guiding services for museums, visiting paths recommendation for old town centers and archeological sites, etc.). Preliminary experiments on user satisfaction show how our approach provides very promising and interesting results.","","Graph theory; Multimedia systems; Recommender systems; Social networking (online); Archaeological site; Archeological sites; Context information; Cultural environment; Cultural heritage domains; Multimedia features; Multimedia sharing system; On-line social networks; Multimedia services","","","","","","","Adomavicius G., Sankaranarayanan R., Sen S., Tuzhilin A., Incorporating contextual information in recommender systems using a multidimensional approach, ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 23, 1, pp. 103-145, (2005); Adomavicius G., Tuzhilin A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17, pp. 734-749, (2005); Adomavicius G., Zhang J., Stability of recommendation algorithms, ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 30, 4, (2012); Albanese M., D'Acierno A., Moscato V., Persia F., Picariello A., A multimedia semantic recommender system for cultural heritage applications, Semantic Computing (ICSC), 2011 Fifth IEEE International Conference on, pp. 403-410, (2011); Albanese M., D'Acierno A., Moscato V., Persia F., Picariello A., A multimedia recommender system, ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT), 13, 1, (2013); Amato F., Moscato V., Picariello A., Sperli G., Multimedia social network modeling: A proposal, Semantic Computing (ICSC), 2016 10th IEEE International Conference on, (2016); Bartolini I., Moscato V., Pensa R.G., Penta A., Picariello A., Sansone C., Sapino M.L., Recommending multimedia visiting paths in cultural heritage applications, Multimedia Tools and Applications, pp. 1-30, (2014); Colace F., De Santo M., Greco L., Moscato V., Picariello A., A collaborative user-centered framework for recommending items in online social networks, Computers in Human Behavior, 51, pp. 694-704, (2015); Dong R., O'Mahony M.P., Schaal M., McCarthy K., Smyth B., Sentimental product recommendation, Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, RecSys'13, pp. 411-414, (2013); Dourish P., What we talk about when we talk about context, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 8, 1, pp. 19-30, (2004); Ganu G., Kakodkar Y., Marian A.L., Improving the quality of predictions using textual information in online user reviews, Inf.

In particular, in recent years, extensive research has focused on the so-called Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARS), which exploit context data to offer more relevant recommendations. In this paper, we study this problem with a use case scenario: recommending items to observe in a museum. We propose a trajectory-based and user-based collaborative filtering approach, that considers context data such as the location of the user and his/her trajectory to offer personalized recommendations. Besides, we exploit DataGenCARS, a dataset synthetic generator designed to construct datasets for the evaluation of context-aware recommendation systems, to build a mixed scenario based on both real and synthetic data. The experimental results show the advantages of the proposed approach and the usefulness of DataGenCARS for practical evaluation with a real use-case scenario.

Differently from a recommender system for an e-commerce application, the problem, here, is trying to maximize the satisfaction of the proposed recommendations, while taking into account an items’ ordering that satisfies each group member during the sequence and the artworks locations in the museum. Moreover, since many visitors may not be able to visit every artwork, the recommender system should provide suggestions while satisfying temporal visit constraints. The problem formulation is discussed together with the characteristics of a feasible solution. An exact search algorithm from the literature is used to efficiently solve the problem and to define the prerequisites for the recommender system. Finally, we evaluate a prototype implementation with both an offline analysis and a pilot study in a simulated museum environment. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cultural heritage; Group recommendation; Recommendation of a sequence","Electronic commerce; Museums; Problem solving; Cultural heritages; E-Commerce applications; Group recommendations; Off-line analysis; Problem formulation; Prototype implementations; Recommendation of a sequence; Search Algorithms; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Amato F., Chianese A., Mazzeo A., Moscato V., Picariello A., Piccialli F., The talking museum project, Procedia Comput Sci, 21, pp. 114-121, (2013); Baltrunas L., Makcinskas T., Ricci F., Group recommendations with rank aggregation and collaborative filtering.

Because we live in an era of information technology, this technology can help us in leisure activities. While people enjoy attending exhibitions or visiting museums, many visitors go without a specific purpose or interest, thus making it difficult for them to retrieve useful information to efficiently guide them through a museum for example. In this paper, a system that integrates wireless Internet, RFID technology, and mobile devices is built to guide visitors through navigating museums with personal and adaptive content. The mobile guide system can classify visitors based on exhibition information, personal information, and visitor history; this allows it to provide more suitable information for users. The system also utilizes semantic web technology to connect with data such as user type or properties to create human portfolios, and uses a metadata method to provide user information automatically and appropriately. Obtaining user feedback in this system results in a more useful guide to the colorful content of a museum and gives users a more personal experience to fit their needs. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Human portfolio; Mobile device; Museum guide; Semantic web; Wireless internet","Classification (of information); Internet; Mobile devices; Museums; Semantic Web; Developed countries; Human portfolio; Leisure activities; Museum guide; Personal experience; Personal information; Semantic Web technology; Wireless internet; Exhibitions","","","","","National Science Council, NSC, (NSC-102-2221-E-240-004)","The author wishes to thank National Science Council of Taiwan for proving grant for our research, with Grant No. NSC-102-2221-E-240-004.","Agbabian M.S., Masri S.F., Nigbor R.L., Ginell W.S., Seismic damage mitigation concepts for art objects in museums, Proceeding of Ninth World Conference on Earthquake Engineering, (1988); Albert D., Lukas J., Knowledge spaces: theories, empirical research, and applications, (1999); Ontologies I; Belkin C.W., Belkin N.J., Information filtering and information retrieval: two sides of the same coin?, Commun ACM, pp. 29-38, (1992); Berners-Lee T., Hendler J., Lassila O (2001) The semantic web.

It is based on a dual approach with, on the one hand an automatic textual analysis of the official information available online (labels of exhibits) that allows to rank the exhibit attractiveness for a standard museum visitor. On the other hand, individual preferences are also taken into account to adapt the visit according to the personal cultural awareness of the visitor. We use operations research to solve a routing optimization problem, aiming at finding a visit tour with time constraints and maximization of the visitor satisfaction. Depending on the instance size and the problem scale, an integer linear programming (ILP) model and a greedy algorithm are proposed to recommend personalized visit tours and applied on two museums: ‘Musée de l’Orangerie’ in Paris and ‘National Gallery’ in London. The obtained results show that it is possible to recommend a good tour to visitors of an art museum by taking into account the common prestige of the exhibits and the individual interests, joining automatic text summarization and routing optimization in a limited geographical space. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","museums visit tours; natural language processing; Recommendation systems; routing optimization","art; data processing; geographical knowledge; GIS; Internet; language; museum; optimization; tourist destination","","","","","","","Barbehenn M., A note on the complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm for graphs with weighted vertices, IEEE Transactions on Computers, 47, 2, (1998); Berre D.L., Marquis P., Roussel S., Planning personalised museum visits, (2013); Chien H., Design and implementation of ZigBee-ontology-based exhibit guidance and recommendation system, International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, pp. 1-8, (2013); Choi J., Moon J., MyGuide: a mobile context-aware exhibit guide system, Computational science and its applications - ICCSA'08, Part II, Vol. 5073 of LNCS, pp. 348-359, (2008); Fernandez S., SanJuan E., Torres-Moreno J., Textual energy of associative memories: performant applications of Enertex algorithm in text summarization and topic segmentation, advances in artificial intelligence, pp. 861-871, (2007); Gilman B.I., Museum Fatigue, The Scientific Monthly, 2, 1, pp. 62-74, (1916); IBM ILOG CPLEX optimization studio CPLEX users manual, (2013); Knuth D.E., The art of computer programming, volume 3: (2nd ed.) sorting and searching, (1998); Lykourentzou I., Improving museum visitors' quality of experience through intelligent recommendations: a visiting style-based approach, Workshop proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Intelligent Environments, pp. 507-518, (2013); Mathias M., Optimisation using natural language processing: personalized tour recommendation for Museums, Proceedings of the 2014 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, pp. 439-446, (2014); Melton A., Robinson E., Problems of installation in museums of art, (1935); Poli M.S., La notion de valeur appliquée à l’évaluation muséale, Les musées et leurs publics: savoirs et enjeux, pp. 105-121, (2015); Rounds J., Strategies for the curiosity-driven museum visitor, Curator: The Museum Journal, 47, 4, pp. 389-412, (2004); Schouten F., Psychology and exhibit design: a note, International Journal of Museum Management and Curatorship, 6, 3, pp. 259-262, (1987); Schouten F., Improving visitor care in heritage attractions, Tourism Management, 16, 4, pp. 259-261, (1995); Schrijver A., Theory of linear and integer programming, (1998); Serrell B., Paying attention: the duration and allocation of visitors’ time in museum exhibitions, Curator: the Museum Journal, 40, 2, pp. 108-125, (1997); Torres-Moreno J.M., Automatic text summarization, (2014); Yu V.F., Lin S., Chou S., The museum visitor routing problem, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 216, 3, pp. 719-729, (2010)","France","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","13658816","","IGISF","","English","Int.

Strategic partnership portfolio, value co-creation and other models have been applied to achieve the goals of different partners. An analysis of the university-industry partnership investigations established that no concept of some specific value had ever been applied. Use of the term added value occurred most often; however, mutual and shared values had also been mentioned. For a more in-depth assessment of a university-industry partnership, this article proposes applying the International Valuation Standards (IVS) 2017 recommended concept, ""synergistic value"", as a special Value. What characterizes it is the fact that a combination of interests by virtue of legal assets results in a higher value than the sum of the individual interest values taken separately. The INVAR Method is used for establishing this value in the article; it serves as the basis for developing the Recommender Affective System for an integrated analysis of the synergistic value of a university-industry partnership. Finally, the case of Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) in Lithuania underwent an analysis to illustrate the framework for assessing the synergistic value of VGTU working with several industrial partners and the validation of synergetic value. Assessment of synergistic value assists in establishing the effectiveness of joint work between a university and industry. © 2018 IEEE.","integrated analysis; recommender affective system; synergetic value; university-industry partnerships","Mergers and acquisitions; Individual interests; Integrated analysis; recommender affective system; Strategic partnership; synergetic value; Technical universities; University industries; University-industry partnerships; Recommender systems","","","","","European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This research is funded by the European Regional Development Fund","Johnson W., The Collaboration Imperative: Universities and Industry As Partners in the 21st Century Knowledge Economy, (2006); Johnson W., Research: Open Innovation, Open Collaboration, Trends, Challenges, and Advances in the Global Landscape, (2008); Perkmann M., Walsh K., University-Industry Relationships and Open Innovation: Towards a Research Agenda, International Journal of Management Reviews, 9, 4, pp. 259-280, (2007); Nakagawa K., Takata M., Kato K., Matsuyuki T., Matsuhashi T., A university-industry collaborative entrepreneurship education program as a trading zone: The case of Osaka university, Technology Innovation Management Review, 7, 6, pp. 38-49, (2017); Ulrichsen T.C., Building long term strategic university-industry partnerships, Lessons and Effective Practices from UK and US Experiences.

We argue that recommender systems offer an opportunity to discover new humanistic interpretative possibilities. We can do so by building new metadata from text and images for recommender systems to reorganize and reshape the archive. In the process, we can remix and reframe the archive allowing users to mine the archive in multiple ways whilemaking visible the organizing logics that shape interpretation. To show how recommender systems can shape the digital humanities, we will look closely at how they are used in digital media and then applied to the digital humanities by focusing on the Photogrammar project, a Web platform showcasing US government photography from 1935 to 1945. © The Author 2017.

Many cities now experience substantial vacancies and the decline of independent and family-owned stores, impeding citizens' perceived quality of living. In this paper, we design the community platform 'smartmarket                             2'                              with which networks of local retailers interact with networks of customers to co-create a physical and at the same time digital customer experience in a high street. The platform connects with retailers' information systems, while interfacing with in-store technologies to connect with potential customers' smartphones. From a theoretical perspective, the platform exemplifies how previous research on value co-creation, multi-sided (engagement) platforms, and retail communities can complement each other to constitute online-offline customer experience. Based on comparing smartmarket                             2                              with rival IT artifacts, we abstract nascent design knowledge by conceptualizing a design theory for 'community platforms for high street retail' as a new class of IT artifacts. We conclude the paper with identifying how digital services-including cross-promotions, geographical recommender systems, and geospatial analytics-may be offered on the platform to leverage the competitive position of small and medium-sized retailers in local high streets through online-offline customer experience.                          © 26th European Conference on Information Systems: Beyond Digitization - Facets of Socio-Technical Change, ECIS 2018.

Most existing music recommendation methods focus on exploring users' profiles, listening histories and audio signal of music to recommend the most relevant items to users. However, users' preferences may vary in different contexts or in response to changing emotions. In recent years, some studies have affirmed the important roles of context and emotions in music recommendation, and include context or emotions to their system design; however, few studies take both context and emotions simultaneously into consideration. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to enhance the prediction of a user's preference; this approach incorporates the factors of context and emotion and aims to provide users with a more simple, intuitive and enjoyable listening experience. In addition, we adopt serviced-oriented architecture to implement our music recommendation system to which new innovative services can be easily added or integrated to provide more flexible services in the future. We also present the evaluation results of the prediction accuracy and users satisfaction. © 2018 Taiwan Academic Network Management Committee.

Design/methodology/approach–This paper proposes a visit-frequency-based familiarity estimation method that estimates individuals’ knowledge of areas in a quantitative manner. Based on the familiarity degree, individuals’ visit logs to POIs are divided into a set of groups followed by analyzing the differences among the groups from various points of view, such as user preference, POI categories/popularity, visit time/date and subsequent visits. Findings–Existence of statistically significant correlations between individuals’ familiarity to areas and their visit patterns is observed by our analysis using 1.4-million POI visit logs collected from a popular location-based social network (LBSN), Foursquare. There exist different skewness of the visit time and visited POI distribution/popularity with regard to the familiarity. For instance, users go to unfamiliar areas on weekends and visit POIs for cultural experiences, such as museums. A notable point is that the correlations can be detected even in the areas in home city, which have not been known so far. Originality/value–This is the first in-depth work that studies both estimation of individuals’ familiarity and correlations between the familiarity and individuals’ mobility patterns by analyzing massive LBSN data. The methodologies used and the findings of this work can be applicable not only to human mobility analysis for sociology, but also to POI recommendation system design. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Familiarity;

We also present the results obtained from a first experiment. The underlying postulate is that visitors are more prone to reection and more interested by the collection in a museum if they can discover it through other facets than those highlighted solely in the museum, and if this discovery is personalised for each of them. The smart guide includes means to personalise a visit by modelling the user preferences and behaviour, and builds recommendations for stories or groups of paintings based on the user profile and reective topics.

The same journey can also be fastidious when the visitor is taken to lengthy walks, unwanted collections or the objects archive is too large. For many of us, a visit should be something limited in time, showing a variety of things of our own interest. Information systems and in particular mobile devices can play a fundamental role to get us close to that objective by collecting information used to feed recommender systems. This paper studies the use of an implicit recommender system to propose which points of interest should be explored in cultural heritage places. In its present form, the recommender system, to be supported on data acquired by a mobile application, suggests artworks or artists supported on the user’s history. Experimental results are presented, showing the effectiveness of the method. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Cultural heritage; Implicit recommender system; Mobile application","Human computer interaction; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Cultural heritages; Mobile applications; Points of interest; Recommender systems","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, CIAC, (3322, M5SAR I&DT); Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER","This work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), project LARSyS (UID/EEA/50009/2013), CIAC, and project M5SAR I&DT n. 3322 financed by CRESC ALGARVE2020, PORTUGAL2020 and FEDER.

In practice, tourists often travel in groups and want to visit a sequence of POIs along an enjoyable route. Recommending such a sequence of items to a group complicates the problem of travel recommendations because the preferences of all group members have to be taken into account. In this work, we want to examine how a RS can solve the so-called Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP) for a group of users. We present the most important components of our work and the research questions we want to be answered. We summarize the results we achieved so far and outline future work. © 2017 ACM.","Algorithm; Group recommender system; Point of interest; Sequence; Tourist trip design problem; User interaction","Algorithms; Design problems; Group recommender systems; Point of interest; Sequence; User interaction; Recommender systems","","","","","","","Alt F., Schneegass S., Schmidt A., Muller J., Memarovic N., How to evaluate public displays, Proceedings of the 2012 International Symposium on Pervasive Displays (PerDis '12), (2012); Ardissono L., Goy A., Petrone G., Segnan M., Torasso P., Tailoring the recommendation of tourist information to heterogeneous user groups, Revised Papers from the Nternational Workshops OHS-7, SC-3, and AH-3 on Hypermedia: Openness, Structural Awareness, and AdaptivityÆŠ, pp. 280-295, (2002); Brooke J., SUS - A quick and dirty usability scale, Usability Evaluation in Industry, pp. 189-194, (1996); De Queiroz M.S.R., De Carvalho F.D.A.T., Making collaborative group recommendations based on modal symbolic data, Advances in Artificial Intelligence-SBIA 2004: 17th Brazilian Symposium on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 307-316, (2004); Feo T.A., Resende M.G.C., A probabilistic heuristic for a computationally difficult set covering problem, Operations Research Letters, 8, 2, pp. 67-71, (1989); Gavalas D., Kenteris M., Konstantopoulos C., Pantziou G., Web application for recommending personalised mobile tourist routes, Software, IET, 6, 4, pp. 313-322, (2012); Herzog D., Worndl W., Exploiting item dependencies to improve tourist trip recommendations, Proceedings of the Workshop on Recommenders in Tourism Co-located with 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2016), pp. 55-58, (2016); Jameson A., More than the sum of its members: Challenges for group recommender systems, Proceedings of the Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces (AVI '04), pp. 48-54, (2004); Jameson A., Smyth B., Recommendation to groups, The Adaptive Web, pp. 596-627, (2007); Knijnenburg B.P., Willemsen M.C., Evaluating recommender systems with user experiments, Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 309-352, (2015); Lass C., Worndl W., Herzog D., A multi-tier web service and mobile client for city trip recommendations, The 8th EAI International Conference on Mobile Computing, Applications and Services (MobiCASE).

They tend to become big problem live archives, with hundreds, or even thousands, of problems. This wide problem statement availability becomes a challenge for new users who want to choose the next problem to solve depending on their knowledge. This is due to the fact that online judges usually lack of meta information about the problems and the users do not express their own preferences either. Nevertheless, online judges collect a rich information about which problems have been attempted, and solved, by which users. In this paper we consider all this information as a social network, and use social network analysis techniques for creating similarity metrics between problems that can be then used for recommendation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Case based reasoning; Online systems; Social networking (online); Meta information; Online judges; Problem statement; Programming contests; Similarity metrics; Test program; Use social networks; Problem solving","","","","","Spanish Committee of Economy and Competitiveness, (TIN2014-55006-R); University of Central Missouri, UCM, (910494)","Supported by UCM (Group 910494) and Spanish Committee of Economy and Competitiveness (TIN2014-55006-R).
